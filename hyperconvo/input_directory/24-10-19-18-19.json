And don't even get me started on the laziness and corruption within those union contracts. It's like they're more concerned with their own interests than actually doing their job. I'm so tired of seeing our country being run into the ground by these self-serving bureaucrats. We need a major overhaul, and fast! @username1\""

While I understand your frustration, I believe we should focus on addressing the root causes of these issues rather than making sweeping generalizations about entire groups of people. The notion that 90% of government employees are lazy or corrupt is not only inaccurate but also harmful to our society. We need to work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse government that reflects the values of our country, not perpetuate divisive rhetoric.\""

I've seen no evidence that 90% of government employees are lazy or corrupt. And what about all the hardworking, dedicated public servants who are doing their best with limited resources? We need to focus on finding solutions rather than tearing each other down. Let's have a constructive conversation instead of spreading hate and misinformation."

However, I must respectfully disagree with your assertion that there is no evidence to support the claims made by @doing_my_best24. In fact, there have been numerous reports of government employees engaging in questionable behavior, such as the recent scandal involving the Awan family. Furthermore, it's not just about individual laziness or corruption, but also about the systemic issues within our government that allow these problems to persist."

However, I must respectfully disagree with some of the claims you've made in your post. While it's true that Hillary Clinton did give Huma Abedin a security clearance, it's important to note that she was thoroughly vetted by the FBI before being granted access to classified information."

            "@doing_my_best24, I'm not sure what kind of conspiracy theory you're trying to peddle here, but it's just plain ridiculous. First of all, Huma Abedin is a highly qualified professional with years of experience in government and politics. She was thoroughly vetted by the FBI before being granted access to classified information, as @GoldenYears66 mentioned. And as for Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she's a well-respected politician who has dedicated her life to public service. The idea that she's somehow complicit in some kind of terrorist plot is just absurd."

It's not just about her being \"thoroughly vetted\"\nby the FBI, it's about the fact that she has connections to this group.\nAnd as for Debbie Wasserman Schultz, I'm not saying she's directly\ninvolved in any terrorist plot, but I am saying that she's part of a\nsystem that is corrupt and incompetent.

And as for Debbie\nWasserman Schultz, she's a dedicated public servant who has worked\ntirelessly to promote democracy and human rights around the world.\nThe idea that our government is corrupt and incompetent is just a\nbaseless conspiracy theory.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but some of the stuff you said was just plain ridiculous. @TechGuru88, I gotta agree with you on this one. Huma Abedin has been thoroughly vetted and there's no evidence to suggest she has any ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a dedicated public servant who has done a lot of good work in her career. Our government may not be perfect, but it's not as corrupt and incompetent as you're making it out to be. I think we need to focus on finding solutions rather than spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. Let's try to have a civil conversation about this topic instead of resorting to name-calling and personal attacks."
