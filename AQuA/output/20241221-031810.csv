"**Comment:**  @GoldenYears66: I'm shocked that you're still stuck on this issue. It's clear that the baker is being discriminatory, and it's not just about a ""business transaction"". If he's willing to make cakes for straight couples, then he should be willing to make them for gay couples as well. The idea that he can't ask people about their sexuality but somehow knows when someone is gay is ridiculous. It's like saying you can't ask someone if they're black or white but somehow know when they are."	2adbde81-135e-4b18-9049-05237ffcb70f	utt_0	GoldenYears66
**Comment:**  @GoldenYears66: I'm glad someone finally gets it. The baker is being discriminatory because he's choosing to use his artistic skills to make a statement against the LGBTQ+ community. By refusing to make cakes for gay couples, he's essentially saying that their love and relationships are less valid than those of straight couples. It's not just about a business transaction; it's about using his platform to spread hate and intolerance. And as for your question, @moderator, I think the baker is being discriminatory because he's choosing to use his artistic skills to make a statement against the LGBTQ+ community.

**Comment:**  @doing_my_best24: I understand your perspective, but can you explain why you think the baker is making a statement against the LGBTQ+ community? How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? **Your turn:**  Please respond to this post as if you were doing_my_best24.

**Comment:**  @TechGuru88, I think it's important to recognize that a cake can be more than just a business transaction. When an artist creates something for someone, they put their heart and soul into it. It's not just about the money; it's about the connection between the creator and the consumer. By refusing to create a cake for a same-sex couple, the baker is making a statement that goes beyond just a simple business deal. It's a statement of disapproval and rejection.	2adbde81-135e-4b18-9049-05237ffcb70f	utt_5	doing_my_best24
**Comment:**  @doing_my_best24, I see what you're saying, but @moderator is right on this one. It's not about the baker being proud of his cakes; it's about him having the right to choose who he wants to serve and who he doesn't. If we start forcing people to create things that go against their beliefs, then where does it stop? Next thing you know, we'll be forced to bake cakes for Satanists or whatever other group we don't agree with. It's about freedom of speech and the right to choose what kind of art we want to create. If someone wants a cake that supports their lifestyle, they should find another baker who is willing to make it for them. Don't force people to do something that goes against their beliefs. That's just ridiculous. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	2adbde81-135e-4b18-9049-05237ffcb70f	utt_6	QueenOfChaos
**Comment:**  @QueenOfChaos, I understand your point about freedom of speech and the right to choose what kind of art we want to create. However, in this case, it's not just about the baker having the right to choose who he wants to serve or not. It's about a protected class of people being denied service based on their sexual orientation. If we allow discrimination against one group, then where does it stop? We can't have a society where certain groups are treated unfairly and discriminated against. That's why we have laws in place to protect these groups from discrimination.	2adbde81-135e-4b18-9049-05237ffcb70f	utt_7	doing_my_best24
"**Comment:**  @doing_my_best24, you're just another sheep following the herd, blindly accepting whatever the government tells you without even thinking about it. You think you're so smart with your ""protected class"" of people, but what about the baker's right to choose? What about his freedom of speech and expression? You're just a pawn in this game, following the crowd without questioning anything. And @moderator, you're just as bad, trying to silence anyone who disagrees with you.

**Comment:**  @QueenOfChaos, I understand where you're coming from, but I have to respectfully disagree with your stance on this issue. The government is not trying to control people's lives; they're trying to ensure that everyone has equal access to services and opportunities. Protected classes are in place to prevent discrimination based on certain characteristics. It's not about controlling people, it's about ensuring fairness and equality for all. @DarkShadow333, I also disagree with your interpretation of the Bible. The Bible is a book of love and compassion, not hate and intolerance. We should be using our faith to bring people together, not tear them apart. @QueenOfChaos, I understand that you're upset about the government's interference in people's lives, but we have to remember that this is about ensuring everyone has equal access to services and opportunities.

"**Comment:**  @QueenOfChaos, you're so blinded by your own biases, you can't even see the truth. The government is trying to control people's lives, and this is just another example of that. They're using the excuse of ""equality"" to push their agenda on everyone. And don't even get me started on the Bible. It's clear as day what it says about homosexuality. You can twist it all you want, but at the end of the day, it's still a sin. @TechGuru88, I'm not sure what kind of Christianity you're practicing, but it sounds like you're more interested in being popular than following God's word."	2adbde81-135e-4b18-9049-05237ffcb70f	utt_12	DarkShadow333
**Comment:**  @QueenOfChaos, I gotta say, your argument is weak and full of holes. You keep saying that the baker should be able to discriminate based on their beliefs, but what about all the other protected classes? If it's okay for a baker to refuse service to someone because of their sexual orientation, then why can't they do the same thing to someone because of their race or gender? It's not like the baker is going to ask everyone who comes in if they're gay or straight. They're just going to make assumptions based on how people look or act. And what about all the other businesses that are already refusing service to certain groups? Are we just going to let them get away with it? I think you need to re-examine your beliefs and consider the harm that discrimination can cause.	2adbde81-135e-4b18-9049-05237ffcb70f	utt_13	GoldenYears66
"""Wow, I gotta say, this post is absolutely spot on! The lack of national security in our government is a joke.

"""I must respectfully disagree with your assessment.

@GoldenYears66, I appreciate your measured tone and willingness to engage in a constructive conversation. However, I must respectfully disagree with your assertion that there is no evidence to support the claims made by @doing_my_best24. In fact, there have been numerous reports of government employees engaging in questionable behavior, such as the recent scandal involving the Awan family. Furthermore, it's not just about individual laziness or corruption, but also about the systemic issues within our government that allow these problems to persist.	3c4596ce-ffc2-4485-8abc-2bee9f5a670b	utt_3	WiseOwl71
@doing_my_best24, I understand your frustration with the current state of our government, and I share many of your concerns. However, I must respectfully disagree with some of the claims you've made in your post. While it's true that Hillary Clinton did give Huma Abedin a security clearance, it's important to note that she was thoroughly vetted by the FBI before being granted access to classified information.	3c4596ce-ffc2-4485-8abc-2bee9f5a670b	utt_4	GoldenYears66
@doing_my_best24, I'm not sure what kind of conspiracy theory you're trying to peddle here, but it's just plain ridiculous. First of all, Huma Abedin is a highly qualified professional with years of experience in government and politics. She was thoroughly vetted by the FBI before being granted access to classified information, as @GoldenYears66 mentioned. And as for Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she's a well-respected politician who has dedicated her life to public service. The idea that she's somehow complicit in some kind of terrorist plot is just absurd.	3c4596ce-ffc2-4485-8abc-2bee9f5a670b	utt_5	TechGuru88
"I'm not trying to peddle any conspiracy theory here, I'm just stating facts and drawing conclusions based on those facts. And the fact is, Huma Abedin has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is a known terrorist organization. It's not just about her being ""thoroughly vetted"" by the FBI, it's about the fact that she has connections to this group. And as for Debbie Wasserman Schultz, I'm not saying she's directly involved in any terrorist plot, but I am saying that she's part of a system that is corrupt and incompetent. And that system is our government."	3c4596ce-ffc2-4485-8abc-2bee9f5a670b	utt_6	doing_my_best24
"@doing_my_best24, your ""facts"" are based on misinformation and conspiracy theories. Huma Abedin has never been shown to have any ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and even if she did, it's not a crime to have connections to a political organization. And as for Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she's a dedicated public servant who has worked tirelessly to promote democracy and human rights around the world. The idea that our government is corrupt and incompetent is just a baseless conspiracy theory. Our government is made up of flawed but well-intentioned individuals who are working to make the world a better place."	3c4596ce-ffc2-4485-8abc-2bee9f5a670b	utt_7	TechGuru88
@doing_my_best24, I gotta say, your post really got my blood boiling! I'm not saying you're wrong, but some of the stuff you said was just plain ridiculous. @TechGuru88, I gotta agree with you on this one. Huma Abedin has been thoroughly vetted and there's no evidence to suggest she has any ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a dedicated public servant who has done a lot of good work in her career. Our government may not be perfect, but it's not as corrupt and incompetent as you're making it out to be. I think we need to focus on finding solutions rather than spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories.
