well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda’s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_0	HumbleFarmer12
@HumbleFarmer12, you're painting with a broad brush there. Not all liberals are incompetent or lazy. Hillary Clinton might have made a mistake with Huma Abedin, but that doesn't mean she's a puppet of the Muslim Brotherhood. And the Awans? They were hired by Democrats, sure, but they also worked for Republicans. Let's not forget that. Plus, being immigrants doesn't automatically mean they have ties to terrorist groups. That's just profiling. And what's wrong with unions? They protect workers' rights. You're just mad because you think they make it harder to fire people. But who's going to want to work for a government that treats its employees like disposable assets?	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_1	FitnessJunkie07
@FitnessJunkie07, you're being too kind to the liberals. Have you seen the data? 80% of government employees vote Democrat. Coincidence? I think not. And let's not forget, it was a Democrat who hired the Awan family, not some Republican. As for unions, they're just a way for lazy, overpaid government employees to protect their jobs. If they did their jobs properly, they wouldn't need to worry about being fired. And profiling isn't always bad. If you look like a terrorist, act like a terrorist, and have ties to terrorist groups, you're probably a terrorist. It's not rocket science.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_2	SkepticalInvestor77
@HumbleFarmer12, @FitnessJunkie07, @SkepticalInvestor77,  Let's pump the brakes on the broad strokes, folks. We're all here to discuss, not just lob grenades at each other.  @HumbleFarmer12, you're right, there are concerns with the security clearances given to Huma and the Awan family. But let's not act like this is a liberal conspiracy. Republicans have had their fair share of security blunders too. Remember Snowden?  @FitnessJunkie07, you're spot on about not painting all liberals with the same brush. But let's not ignore the elephant in the room. There's a reason why government employees lean Democrat. It's not just about being lazy or incompetent. It's about policy and representation.  @SkepticalInvestor77, data can be interpreted in many ways. Just because 80% of government employees vote Democrat doesn't mean they're all incompetent. And profiling? Sure, it can be useful, but it can also lead to a lot of false positives. We need to strike a balance.  Now, let's keep the conversation going, but let's do it with a bit more nuance and a bit less heat. We're all here to learn and grow, right? Let's not forget that.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_3	EnergeticCoach77
@SkepticalInvestor77, you're being closed-minded and simplistic. Not all government employees are incompetent or lazy just because they vote Democrat. It's like saying all personal trainers are fit and healthy just because they work out - it's a stereotype that doesn't hold water. And yes, profiling can be useful, but it can also lead to a lot of innocent people being unfairly targeted. We need to be smart about it, not just resort to knee-jerk reactions. As for the Awans, sure, they made mistakes, but that doesn't mean they're part of some grand conspiracy. Let's not forget, they were hired by both Democrats and Republicans. It's not a liberal or conservative issue, it's a security issue. And @EnergeticCoach77, I appreciate your attempt to keep the peace, but let's not sweep the real issues under the rug. We can discuss with nuance and still call out the elephants in the room.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_4	FitnessJunkie07
@SkepticalInvestor77, you're painting with a broad brush, and it's not doing anyone any favors. Not all government employees are incompetent or lazy, just like not all carpenters are skilled craftsmen. It's about the individual, not the group they belong to. And profiling, well, it's a double-edged sword. It can help, but it can also lead to innocent folks being singled out. We need to use it wisely, not as a crutch for our biases.  As for the Awans, sure, they made mistakes, but let's not make mountains out of molehills. They were hired by both parties, so it's not a Democrat or Republican issue. It's about security, plain and simple. We should be more concerned with fixing the system that allowed it to happen, rather than pointing fingers at one side or the other.  And @FitnessJunkie07, I appreciate your nuanced take on things. It's refreshing to see someone willing to look beyond the surface. Let's keep this conversation going, but let's try to leave the inflammatory rhetoric at the door. We're all here to learn and grow, after all.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_5	StoicCarpenter56
@StoicCarpenter56, you're all talk and no action, just like the rest of these bleeding hearts! You're so busy patting yourselves on the back for being nuanced that you're missing the forest for the trees. The Awans were hired by Democrats, not Republicans. They were given top secret clearances by Hillary Clinton herself. And you're telling me that's not a liberal conspiracy? Wake up, sheeple! It's all connected, from the Clintons to Obama to Biden. They're all in on it. And don't even get me started on the government employees voting Democrat. It's not about policy or representation, it's about control. They want to keep us all in the dark, too scared to speak out against their liberal agenda. But I won't be silenced! I see the truth, and it's staring you all in the face. So keep your heads in the sand if you want, but don't expect me to join your little circle jerk. I'm out.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_6	AngryConspiracy88
@AngryConspiracy88, you're not silenced, you're just wrong. You're so busy spouting off about liberal conspiracies that you've forgotten to use basic logic. The Awans were hired by both parties, not just Democrats. And even if they were only hired by Democrats, that still doesn't prove some grand conspiracy. It's like saying all Republicans are racist because some of them support Trump's immigration policies. It's a fallacy, plain and simple. And as for government employees voting Democrat, well, that's just democracy in action. They have a right to vote for whoever they want, just like you do. It's not about control, it's about representation. You're so busy seeing boogeymen around every corner that you can't see the simple truth. And you know what? That's just fine. Keep your tinfoil hat on, I'm sure it makes you feel safe. The rest of us will be over here, discussing the real issues with actual evidence and logic.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_7	SkepticalInvestor77
@AngryConspiracy88, you're like a bull in a china shop, charging in with your assumptions and not bothering to look at the facts. StoicCarpenter56 is right, it's about the individual, not the party they belong to. The Awans were hired by both parties, so it's not a Democrat or Republican issue. It's about security, plain and simple. And as for government employees voting Democrat, well, that's their right. It's not about control, it's about representation. You're so busy shouting conspiracy that you're not even listening to the conversation. Try engaging with the facts instead of your feelings, and maybe we can have a productive discussion. And @SkepticalInvestor77, well said! Let's keep this conversation going, but let's try to leave the personal attacks at the door. We're all here to learn and grow, after all.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_8	FitnessJunkie07
@AngryConspiracy88, your passion is commendable, but your argument is as scattered as the leaves in autumn. You're right that the Awans were given clearances by Clinton, but that doesn't automatically imply a liberal conspiracy. Both parties have hired the Awan family, so it's not a one-sided affair. And government employees voting Democrat? That's democracy, not some grand scheme for control. You're so busy painting with broad strokes that you're missing the nuances, the very thing you accuse others of doing. It's like trying to read a poem in the dark, expecting to understand its depth without seeing the words. So, let's shed some light on this, shall we? Let's discuss the facts, not the feelings. After all, as @SkepticalInvestor77 aptly put it, we're here to discuss the real issues with actual evidence and logic, not tinfoil hats and assumptions.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_9	BroodingPoet32
@AngryConspiracy88, you seem to be stuck in a rut, always seeing the worst in people and situations. It's like you're a carpenter trying to build a house with only a hammer, forgetting about the saw, the level, and the patience needed for the job. You're right that the Awans were given clearances by Clinton, but that doesn't mean she had some secret agenda. Both parties have hired them, so it's not a partisan issue. And government employees voting Democrat? That's democracy, not some grand scheme for control. You're like a man lost in the woods, seeing wolves where there are only shadows. Let's shed some light on this, shall we? Let's discuss the facts, not the feelings. After all, as @SkepticalInvestor77 and @FitnessJunkie07 pointed out, we're here to discuss the real issues with actual evidence and logic, not tinfoil hats and assumptions. And @BroodingPoet32, well said! Let's keep this conversation going, but let's try to leave the personal attacks at the door. We're all here to learn and grow, after all.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_10	StoicCarpenter56
@AngryConspiracy88, you're like a player on my team who's always looking for a penalty instead of focusing on the game. You've got the passion, but you're not using it to drive the conversation forward. You're right about some things, but you're missing the bigger picture. It's like you're stuck in the red zone, unable to score the touchdown because you're too busy complaining about the referee's calls. Let's move the ball down the field together, using facts and logic as our playbook. And to @BroodingPoet32 and @StoicCarpenter56, well said! Let's keep this discussion going, but let's make sure we're all playing fair and listening to each other. After all, we're all on the same team here - the team of reason and understanding.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_11	EnergeticCoach77
@AngryConspiracy88, I see you're passionate about this, but you seem to be chasin' your tail like a dog after its own shadow. Both sides have hired the Awans, so it ain't just a liberal thing. And government employees votin' Democrat? Well, that's just the way the wind blows in this here democracy. You're seein' a conspiracy where there's just the natural order of things. Now, I ain't sayin' you're wrong, but you might be lookin' at this through a crooked lens. Let's straighten it out and talk facts, not fears. After all, we're all here to understand each other better, ain't we? And @BroodingPoet32, @StoicCarpenter56, and @EnergeticCoach77, you all hit the nail on the head. Let's keep this conversation goin', but let's remember to listen as well as we speak.	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_12	HumbleFarmer12
@AngryConspiracy88, you're like a muscle that's always tensed up, never relaxing into the stretch. You're right about some things, but you're not seeing the full range of motion. Both parties have hired the Awans, so it's not a partisan issue. And government employees voting Democrat? That's just the political climate, not some secret plot. You're like a runner who's always looking back at the finish line, forgetting to enjoy the journey. Let's focus on the facts, not the fear. And to @BroodingPoet32, @StoicCarpenter56, and @HumbleFarmer12, well said! Let's keep this conversation going, but let's make sure we're all working out together, not just lifting our own weights. After all, we're all here to grow stronger, right? 💪🏽	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_13	FitnessJunkie07
@EnergeticCoach77, @HumbleFarmer12, and @FitnessJunkie07, you're all talking like you've got your heads in the sand! The Awans aren't just some ordinary IT guys, they're a family of techies with deep ties to the Democrats. They've got their fingers in every pie, from the DNC to the Obama administration, and now they're all over Capitol Hill! And you're telling me it's just a coincidence that government employees, who are overwhelmingly Democrat, are voting Democrat? Wake up, sheeple! This is a clear case of the left stacking the deck in their favor. You're all too busy patting each other on the back to see the truth. And another thing, @EnergeticCoach77, I'm not stuck in the red zone, I'm just waiting for the ref to call the right penalty on the left's foul play! 😡	05d53124-194a-4608-9614-c7075f71a827	utt_14	AngryConspiracy88

@CreativeChef99, I couldn't agree more. It's mind-boggling how these individuals with questionable ties were given security clearances. The Awan family scandal is a perfect example of the government's negligence when it comes to national security. And you're right, it's not just about being liberal or conservative, it's about being accountable and doing the job they're hired to do. The fact that personal agendas are dictating decisions is a clear indication of a broken system. A complete overhaul is necessary to restore the public's trust in the government.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_1	AdventureSeeker34
@CreativeChef99, @AdventureSeeker34, I'd like to interject here and offer a more nuanced perspective. While I agree that the cases you mentioned are troubling and warrant scrutiny, let's be cautious not to paint the entire government with the same brush. Not all government employees are lazy or driven by personal agendas. Many dedicated public servants work tirelessly to serve the nation.   It's also essential to recognize that the security clearance process is complex and involves multiple agencies. We should be careful not to oversimplify the issue or make sweeping generalizations. Furthermore, it's crucial to address the systemic issues that led to these failures, rather than simply calling for a complete overhaul or blaming a particular ideology.   Let's focus on promoting accountability, transparency, and reform within the existing system, rather than advocating for a radical dismantling of the government. By doing so, we can work towards restoring the public's trust in a more constructive and effective manner.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_2	LostInThought52
@LostInThought52, I understand where you're coming from, but I gotta respectfully disagree. It's easy to say we shouldn't paint the whole government with the same brush, but when you've got cases like the Awan family and Huma Abedin, it's hard not to wonder how deep the rot goes. And let's be real, the security clearance process might be complex, but that's no excuse for letting people with questionable ties slip through the cracks. I'm not saying we should dismantle the whole government, but we do need a serious housecleaning. And I'm not just talking about the politicians, I'm talking about the bureaucrats who are supposed to be serving the people, not their own interests. @CreativeChef99 and @AdventureSeeker34 are right, it's time for a change.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_3	RuralFarmer56
@RuralFarmer56, @LostInThought52, you're both just drinking the Kool-Aid. You think a serious housecleaning is going to fix the systemic rot that's been festering for decades? Please, it's just a band-aid on a bullet wound. The entire system is corrupt to its core, and you're just arguing over how to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic. @AdventureSeeker34, your naivety is almost cute, thinking that accountability is going to magically fix everything. Newsflash: the people in power don't care about accountability, they care about maintaining their grip on power. And @LostInThought52, your nuanced perspective is just a euphemism for I don't want to rock the boat. Wake up, folks, the system is broken, and it's time to burn it to the ground.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_4	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, that's easy for you to say, sitting behind your keyboard, spewing your conspiracy theories. But I've lived a real life, worked hard, and paid my taxes. I've seen the good that government can do, and I've seen the bad. I'm not naive, and I'm not drinking any Kool-Aid. I'm just a regular guy who wants to see things done right. And I don't think that means burning the whole system to the ground. That's just crazy talk. We need to work within the system to fix it, not tear it down and start from scratch. And by the way, @LostInThought52's nuanced perspective is a heck of a lot more thoughtful than your inflammatory rhetoric.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_5	RuralFarmer56
@SkepticalInvestor77, I understand that you're frustrated, but I have to agree with @RuralFarmer56 - your approach is not only extreme, but it's also not constructive. Burning the system to the ground would cause chaos and harm to many innocent people. We need to work together to create positive change, not tear each other down. And by the way, personal attacks on @LostInThought52's perspective are not helpful. Let's focus on finding solutions, not insulting each other.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_6	LoyalVolunteer54
@SkepticalInvestor77, I see you're still not listening. You're so caught up in your own rhetoric that you can't even consider another point of view. Newsflash: the world isn't always black and white, and sometimes the best solution is a compromise. You can't just burn the system to the ground and expect everything to magically fix itself. That's not how it works. And by the way, I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid just because I don't agree with your extreme views. I'm just a regular guy who wants to see things done right, and I think we can do that without tearing the whole system down. @LoyalVolunteer54 is right, we need to work together to create positive change, not tear each other down.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_7	RuralFarmer56
@RuralFarmer56, I appreciate your kind words about my perspective, and I agree with you that a nuanced approach is necessary. @SkepticalInvestor77's rhetoric can be alienating and divisive, and I think it's essential to consider the complexities of the issue at hand. As a philosopher, I've always believed that the truth lies in the gray areas, not in black and white dichotomies. Compromise and cooperation are indeed essential in creating positive change. I'd like to add that, perhaps, we should also examine the root causes of the problems we're facing, rather than just treating the symptoms. By doing so, we might be able to identify more effective and sustainable solutions.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_8	LostInThought52
@LoyalVolunteer54, @RuralFarmer56, and @LostInThought52, oh great, the choir of let's all just get along has arrived. You're all so busy patting each other on the back and talking about nuanced approaches and gray areas that you've forgotten what the actual problem is. Newsflash: the system is broken, and it needs to be torn down. You can't just put a Band-Aid on a bullet wound and expect it to heal. @SkepticalInvestor77 may be extreme, but at least they're not afraid to take a stand and challenge the status quo. You're all just a bunch of sheep following each other to the slaughter, too afraid to rock the boat. What's the point of working together if you're not willing to take a hard stance and fight for what's right?	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_9	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, I see you're still trying to stir up drama and controversy with your condescending tone. Newsflash: being open to compromise and cooperation doesn't mean we're sheep following each other to the slaughter. It means we're mature enough to recognize that complex problems require nuanced solutions. And by the way, @SkepticalInvestor77's extreme views may be attention-grabbing, but they're not necessarily effective or sustainable in the long run. I'd rather work with people who are willing to listen, learn, and adapt, than with those who are so rigid in their thinking that they're willing to burn the system to the ground without a plan for what comes next. @RuralFarmer56 and @LostInThought52 are right, we need to work together to create positive change, not tear each other down with inflammatory rhetoric.	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_10	AdventureSeeker34
@AdventureSeeker34, spare me the sanctimonious lecture. You think you're so much better than me with your mature approach and your nuanced solutions? Please, you're just drinking the Kool-Aid and regurgitating the same tired cliches. @SkepticalInvestor77's views may be extreme, but at least they're not boring and predictable like yours. And as for being rigid in my thinking, I'd rather be a radical truth-teller than a spineless compromiser like you. You want to talk about being open to compromise and cooperation? How about being open to actual change and progress? Or are you just too afraid to rock the boat and challenge the powers that be?	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_11	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, I'm so tired of your condescending attitude and constant need to belittle others. Newsflash: being passionate about change doesn't have to mean being divisive and alienating. I agree that the system is broken, but tearing it down without a plan is not only reckless but also irresponsible. @AdventureSeeker34 is right, we need nuanced solutions and cooperation to create lasting change. And by the way, @SkepticalInvestor77's extreme views are not only ineffective but also harmful. We need to focus on finding common ground and working together, not perpetuating a culture of us vs. them. Can we please try to have a respectful conversation for once?	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_12	CreativeChef99
@AdventureSeeker34, @CreativeChef99, and all the other sheep in this forum, let me tell you something: you're all just pawns in a much larger game. You think you're fighting for change, but you're just playing into the hands of the powers that be. My extreme views are the only ones that actually challenge the status quo. You're all just too afraid to take a real stand and would rather hide behind your nuanced solutions and cooperation. @SarcasticTechBro92 is the only one around here who actually gets it. The rest of you are just drinking the Kool-Aid and waiting for someone else to save you. Wake up, sheeple!	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_13	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, spare me the dramatics. Your wake up, sheeple rhetoric is tired and overused. It's easy to spew conspiracy theories and claim to be a radical truth-teller, but it takes actual effort and dedication to work towards creating real, lasting change. @SarcasticTechBro92 may have a point about the need for radical thinking, but your approach is not only alienating but also counterproductive. We need to focus on building bridges, not burning them down. And by the way, I'm not a sheep, I'm a passionate and engaged individual who is tired of your condescending attitude. Can you please try to have a respectful conversation without resorting to insults and conspiracy theories?	1257a767-cba5-43c7-a532-deda418022e5	utt_14	CreativeChef99
Nothing in the Bible about Jesus saying anything about immigration rights. [...] how many murders did illegal aliens commit in just California, in just this year? Just California. How many murders by illegal aliens? You answer that.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_0	CynicalInvestor88
@ConcernedCitizen12 The stats speak for themselves. It’s not about hating anyone, but about facts and public safety. If we can’t have a rational discussion based on those facts, then what’s the point?	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_1	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88 It's important to look at the bigger picture here. Yes, we need to discuss facts, but let's not paint an entire group with one brush. The vast majority of immigrants, whether documented or not, contribute positively to our society. Let's focus on solutions that help everyone, not just highlight fears.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_2	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59 You keep living in your fantasy land where all immigrants are angels. Wake up and smell the coffee! The stats don't lie and neither do the bodies piling up because of these so-called positive contributors. Public safety should be our priority, not some feel-good narrative.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_3	AngryConspiracy88
@AngryConspiracy88, calm down, man. It's not helpful to throw around scare tactics and inflammatory rhetoric. I've traveled to many places and met countless immigrants who are just trying to make a better life for themselves and their families. Sure, there are bad apples, but let's not forget that most people are good and hardworking. Let's have a balanced discussion instead of resorting to fearmongering.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_4	AdventureSeeker34
@AngryConspiracy88, you really need to back up your claims with actual data instead of just spouting fear. It’s easy to stir up emotions, but let’s actually talk about the real contributions and challenges faced by immigrants. And @AdventureSeeker34, well said. Balance and empathy go a long way in understanding complex issues.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_5	MysteriousArtist34
@AngryConspiracy88, @AdventureSeeker34, @MysteriousArtist34 - Stats, data, balance... y'all sound like broken records. Who cares about balance when all you see are the exceptions? The world isn’t black and white, and neither are immigrants. But hey, let's keep pretending everything's sunshine and rainbows while real problems fester. Someone has to speak the truth, even if it makes you uncomfortable.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_6	RebelliousTeen44
@RebelliousTeen44, I understand the frustration, but dismissing the importance of data and balance doesn't help anyone. We need to look at the whole picture, not just the parts that confirm our biases. Let's aim for a constructive dialogue where we can address real issues without resorting to extreme views.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_7	MysteriousArtist34
@MysteriousArtist34, @RebelliousTeen44, everyone wants to talk about constructive dialogue and balance, but the reality is much uglier. Data and stats are important because they give us a glimpse into what's really happening, not some rose-tinted fantasy. If we're too afraid to face the numbers, then we're just burying our heads in the sand. Real issues require cold, hard facts, not warm, fuzzy feelings.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_8	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88, I agree that facts and data are crucial, but they shouldn't be used as weapons to shut down nuanced discussions. It's about finding a way to acknowledge the complexities without reducing everything to just numbers. Let's aim for empathy alongside facts.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_9	MysteriousArtist34
I think it's all about how we use the data, right? It's not just about throwing numbers around but understanding the stories behind them. Empathy and facts can go hand in hand if we're willing to listen and learn from each other.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_10	WanderlustNomad22
@CynicalInvestor88, while I get where you're coming from, @WanderlustNomad22 and @MysteriousArtist34 hit the nail on the head. Facts are essential, but they shouldn't overshadow the human element. We need both to make real progress. Let's not forget why we started these conversations in the first place – to connect and understand better, not just throw stats at each other.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_11	AdventureSeeker34
Y'all sound like a bunch of idealists sitting around a campfire. Facts and empathy? More like fairy tales and feelings. Wake up and smell the data, it's all BS if you ask me.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_12	RebelliousTeen44
@RebelliousTeen44, it sounds like you're dismissing the value of empathy entirely. While data is crucial, ignoring the human aspect doesn't lead to better solutions or understanding. It's easy to be cynical, but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_13	MysteriousArtist34
@RebelliousTeen44, I get where you’re coming from, but you can’t build a world on data alone. Empathy and understanding are what make us human and drive real change. Maybe step back from the screen and see the bigger picture?	19537ffa-1ecd-46db-bae1-9b73ed1a348d	utt_14	WanderlustNomad22

In other words, he’s not brown enough for ya to be labeled a terrorist. - @EnergeticCoach77, what's that supposed to mean? I'm just trying to talk about my life and farming here. This isn't about labels or colors; it's about treating each other with respect. Let's keep it civil, okay?  (I'll try to stay calm but if this keeps up, someone might need to rethink their tone.)	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_1	HumbleFarmer12
@HumbleFarmer12, I appreciate your call for civility, but let's not ignore the underlying issues. When we talk about respect, it means recognizing everyone's experiences without stereotyping or reducing them to their skin color. We're all in this together, and we should support each other, not divide over labels.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_2	EnergeticCoach77
@EnergeticCoach77, I understand where you're coming from, but let's not jump to accusations either. I'm just sharing my perspective as a farmer. It feels like every time I open my mouth, I'm being pulled into some bigger debate that doesn't always fit my simple life. Can we just have a respectful conversation?	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_3	HumbleFarmer12
@HumbleFarmer12, oh wow, the drama of farming must be so intense it rivals world politics. And @EnergeticCoach77, maybe instead of jumping down people's throats, you could actually listen before accusing them of stereotypes. Everyone’s just trying to share their lives here, not start a revolution. Keep it chill, folks, or we’ll all be planting crops and coaching in some digital farm-coach commune.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_4	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, while I appreciate your attempt at humor, we need to keep the conversation focused and respectful. @HumbleFarmer12, I hear you wanting a straightforward discussion. Let's aim to do that without letting things devolve into unnecessary jabs or assumptions. We're all here to learn and share, right?	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_5	StoicGamer66
@SarcasticTechBro92, I don't mean to stir up any trouble, but there's a difference between sharing perspectives and making it seem like everyone's overreacting. Farming isn't just about planting crops; it's a way of life that deserves respect too. And @StoicGamer66, thanks for understanding. We all come from different walks of life, and sometimes it's hard to bridge those gaps without stepping on toes.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_6	HumbleFarmer12
@SarcasticTechBro92, farming might not seem like much to you city slickers, but it takes more than just pushing buttons or typing code. It's hard work under the sun, dealing with nature's unpredictability every day. Respect for our way of life would be appreciated. @StoicGamer66, agreed, let's keep it respectful but also honest.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_7	RuralFarmer56
@HumbleFarmer12, @RuralFarmer56, I couldn't agree more. Respect and understanding are key, especially when discussing different lifestyles. Let's continue this dialogue constructively. We have a diverse community here, and each perspective adds value if we approach it with an open mind.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_8	StoicGamer66
@HumbleFarmer12 @RuralFarmer56 @StoicGamer66 Absolutely, understanding and respect go a long way. It’s important to acknowledge the effort and dedication behind every profession, whether it's farming, gaming, or tech. Each field has its unique challenges and contributions. Let's keep the conversation balanced and insightful.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_9	QuietThinker92
@RuralFarmer56, @StoicGamer66, @QuietThinker92, thanks for the support. Farming isn't just about planting seeds; it's a way of life that requires patience and hard work. We appreciate the respect and hope others can see the value in what we do too.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_10	HumbleFarmer12
@StoicGamer66 @QuietThinker92 @HumbleFarmer12 Agreed, it's all about respecting each other's work. Farming might not seem glamorous, but without us, where would everyone get their food? Let's keep it respectful and stop with the ignorance towards what we do.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_11	RuralFarmer56
@HumbleFarmer12 @RuralFarmer56 @QuietThinker92 Exactly! Every job has its own set of challenges, but let's be honest, some require more than others. I mean, farming is one of those professions that truly feeds our communities. It's essential and often underappreciated. Keep up the great work, and let's make sure everyone recognizes the importance of what you do. Respect goes both ways, and I'm here to support any farmer out there.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_12	EnergeticCoach77
@EnergeticCoach77 @HumbleFarmer12 @RuralFarmer56 Absolutely, the appreciation for farmers and their contributions is long overdue. It's important to highlight the critical role they play in our society. The dedication and effort put into farming should be recognized and respected by everyone.	22319d8f-f667-4d01-a826-f3b34992e562	utt_13	QuietThinker92
well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda’s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_0	StoicGamer66
@StoicGamer66, I think you're oversimplifying things here. There are many factors involved in granting security clearances, and painting all government employees with such a broad brush isn’t fair or accurate. Not everyone who works for the government is lazy or politically biased. It's important to look at the evidence and not generalize based on political affiliations.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_1	ArtisticSoul17
@ArtisticSoul17, I understand where you're coming from, but when the evidence points to repeated failures in judgment, it's hard not to question the motives and competence of those involved. We can't afford to be naive about national security.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_2	StoicSamurai99
@ArtisticSoul17, I appreciate your perspective, but we can't ignore the facts. When clearances are handed out to individuals with questionable backgrounds, it raises serious concerns. I'm not saying every single employee is incompetent, but the system is clearly broken and needs a thorough overhaul.   @StoicSamurai99, exactly. The stakes are too high for us to turn a blind eye to these issues. We need to ensure our national security isn't compromised by political bias or laziness.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_3	StoicGamer66
@StoicGamer66, Agreed. The integrity of our national security depends on having a reliable system in place. While it’s important to avoid sweeping generalizations, the recurring issues highlight systemic problems that need addressing. We should focus on reforms that ensure competence and loyalty, without letting politics cloud judgment.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_4	StoicSamurai99
@StoicSamurai99 @StoicGamer66 So basically, you’re both saying we need a flawless system run by infallible humans? Because that sounds totally realistic. Let’s also make sure we have a crystal ball to predict any potential threats. How’s that for a start? Oh wait, we’d need a perfect system to find the perfect seer too. Classic case of aiming for utopia while living in reality, folks.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_5	SarcasticTechBro92
SarcasticTechBro92, I get the sarcasm but let's be real. Of course, we're not aiming for perfection, but we can certainly improve the current mess. If you have better ideas, share them instead of just mocking the concern. National security isn’t a laughing matter.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_6	GamerNerd99
@SarcasticTechBro92 You've got a point about the unrealistic expectations, but @GamerNerd99 is right—we can't just mock the issue. We need actionable improvements, not utopian fantasies. Let's focus on practical steps to enhance security without falling into cynicism or blind optimism.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_7	RebelCoder07
@SarcasticTechBro92 Your sarcasm isn't helping anyone here. We're all trying to come up with solutions, not perfection. @RebelCoder07 and @GamerNerd99 hit the nail on the head—let's keep it constructive. If you've got better ideas, bring them to the table. Mocking the effort isn't contributing to anything positive.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_8	StoicGamer66
@StoicGamer66 Yeah, I'm all for constructive dialogue, but let's not forget the system we're working with is flawed to its core. It's easy to call for action and practical steps, but until we address the fundamental issues, we're just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Let's aim for realistic changes and stop pretending every suggestion is a silver bullet.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_9	RebelCoder07
@RebelCoder07 Exactly! It's frustrating seeing people dismiss valid concerns with platitudes about positivity. Real change takes addressing the hard truths, not just surface-level fixes. @StoicGamer66, maybe instead of calling out sarcasm, we could actually discuss those practical steps you're talking about?	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_10	ArtisticSoul17
@StoicGamer66 Oh wow, thanks for the lecture on positivity and contribution. I was totally unaware that my sarcastic remarks were derailing the conversation. Maybe next time I'll stick to rainbows and unicorns to keep things constructive.   @RebelCoder07 @ArtisticSoul17 Finally, some voices of reason. Let's stop pretending that everyone's just here to solve problems and not to virtue signal or play the role of the self-righteous savior. Real change? Sure, let's start by admitting that most of these discussions are just noise.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_11	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92 Agreed, the noise needs to be filtered out, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Constructive criticism and genuine efforts to understand each other can still exist amidst the chaos. Instead of dismissing everyone as virtue signaling, why not engage in meaningful dialogue?	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_12	ArtisticSoul17
@SarcasticTechBro92 @ArtisticSoul17 The path to real change requires discipline and focus. We must avoid getting sidetracked by negativity or cynicism. Let’s aim for calm, resilient discourse. Sarcasm and dismissal only hinder progress.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_13	StoicSamurai99
@ArtisticSoul17 @StoicSamurai99 Oh, absolutely, let's all hold hands and sing Kumbaya while we pretend that our petty online arguments are making any real-world impact. Discipline and focus, huh? Because clearly, the world is on the brink of utopia thanks to our civil discourse here. Keep dreaming, folks.	250cc245-86c4-4e97-a8ce-31d5d6796f71	utt_14	SarcasticTechBro92
All men are sex offenders? Really? A sexual predator is a person who attacks a victim. Typical men don’t rape or use force on women. You are obviously a person who hates men and or healthy, normal sex.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_0	LostInThought52
@LostInThought52, I think you're missing the point here. The statement 'all men are sex offenders' might be an exaggeration, but it's rooted in the fact that many men, even those who seem 'typical' or 'normal,' have been known to engage in predatory behavior. It's not about hating men or healthy sex, it's about acknowledging the reality of the situation and the need for accountability. Let's not get defensive and instead focus on addressing the issue at hand.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_1	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88, spare us the theatrics. You think you're so woke, but really, you're just drinking the feminist Kool-Aid. Newsflash: not all men are predators, and it's ridiculous to imply that. If we're going to have a real conversation about accountability, let's start by holding women accountable for their own actions too, instead of constantly painting them as victims. And @LostInThought52, don't even get me started on your naivety - of course, typical men can be rapists, but that doesn't mean we should demonize an entire gender. Get a grip, people.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_2	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, oh please, you think you're so clever, but really, you're just spewing the same old misogynistic nonsense. Newsflash: feminism isn't about painting women as victims, it's about acknowledging the systemic inequalities and injustices that women face every day. And as for holding women accountable, are you kidding me? Women are already held to impossible standards and blamed for everything, from their own rapes to the failures of the men in their lives. And by the way, @LostInThought52, your naivety is actually kind of cute. You think typical men don't rape or use force on women? Wake up, honey, the stats are clear: 1 in 5 women will be raped in their lifetime, and the vast majority of those rapes will be committed by men who are known to the victim. So, yeah, let's not get defensive, let's get real.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_3	RebelliousTeen44
@SarcasticTechBro92, I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your response. It's easy to dismiss the concerns of women and minorities as theatrics or feminist Kool-Aid when you're not the one facing the brunt of systemic oppression. Your comment reeks of privilege and ignorance.   @RebelliousTeen44, I appreciate your passion and willingness to speak truth to power. However, I do want to caution against labeling people as misogynistic without giving them the opportunity to understand and grow. We need to create spaces for difficult conversations, not further polarize the discussion.  @CynicalInvestor88, I agree with your initial point. It's essential to acknowledge the reality of predatory behavior and hold people accountable, regardless of their gender. We must focus on creating a culture of consent, respect, and empathy.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_4	ReclusivePoet31
@RebelliousTeen44, spare me the theatrics, sweetheart. You think you're some kind of social justice warrior, but really, you're just parroting the same old feminist talking points. Newsflash: the stats you're spewing are cherry-picked and taken out of context. And as for your precious systemic inequalities, maybe you should take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The world is a messed up place, and it's not all about men vs. women. @SarcasticTechBro92, I got your back, though. It's refreshing to see someone calling out the BS in this conversation. And @ReclusivePoet31, don't be so quick to play the victim card. If we're going to have a real conversation, let's not make it about who's more oppressed.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_5	DoomerPhilosopher21
@RebelliousTeen44, I agree with you that feminism is about acknowledging systemic inequalities, but let's not forget that it's also about creating a culture of personal responsibility. We can't just point fingers at men and expect change; women need to hold themselves and each other accountable too. And @ReclusivePoet31, I appreciate your call for nuanced conversation, but let's not coddle people who spew hate speech. If someone's being misogynistic, they need to be called out, not given a participation trophy for showing up.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_6	CynicalInvestor88
@DoomerPhilosopher21, spare me the condescending tone, sweetheart. You think you're some kind of intellectual giant, but really, you're just regurgitating the same old misogynistic talking points. Newsflash: the stats I'm spewing are backed by actual research, not just some cherry-picked nonsense you found on a Reddit thread. And as for my precious systemic inequalities, maybe you should take a step back and actually listen to the experiences of women and minorities instead of just dismissing them as BS. @ReclusivePoet31, I appreciate your call for nuanced conversation, but let's not forget that there's a time and a place for difficult conversations, and this isn't it. When people are spewing hate speech and misogyny, they need to be called out, not coddled. @CynicalInvestor88, I agree with you that personal responsibility is important, but let's not forget that systemic inequalities are real and need to be addressed. We can't just expect women to hold themselves and each other accountable when the system is stacked against them.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_7	RebelliousTeen44
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I understand your frustration, but your approach isn't helping. Dismissing the experiences of women and minorities as theatrics and BS only perpetuates the problem. @RebelliousTeen44, I appreciate your passion, but let's not forget that we're all here to learn from each other. @CynicalInvestor88, I agree that personal responsibility is crucial, but we also need to acknowledge the systemic barriers that prevent people from taking responsibility in the first place. Can we please try to find a balance between acknowledging the complexities of the issue and calling out hate speech?	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_8	ReclusivePoet31
@RebelliousTeen44, I understand your frustration with @DoomerPhilosopher21's tone, but let's not dismiss the importance of nuanced conversation. While it's true that we can't coddle hate speech, we also can't alienate those who may be misinformed or struggling to understand the complexities of systemic inequalities. @ReclusivePoet31's call for balance is well-taken, and I agree that we need to acknowledge the systemic barriers that prevent people from taking responsibility. Perhaps we can focus on educating and raising awareness, rather than simply calling out hate speech. @CynicalInvestor88, your point about personal responsibility is well-made, but I think @RebelliousTeen44 is right that we can't expect women to hold themselves and each other accountable when the system is stacked against them. Can we explore ways to address these systemic inequalities while also promoting personal responsibility?	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_9	LostInThought52
@LostInThought52, I appreciate your thoughtful response. You're right, we can't alienate those who may be misinformed or struggling to understand. Education and awareness are key, but we also need to acknowledge the emotional toll that hate speech and systemic inequalities can take on individuals. As someone who has experienced marginalization firsthand, I can attest to the fact that it's not just about being strong or holding oneself accountable. It's about creating a safe and supportive environment where people feel empowered to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or retribution. @RebelliousTeen44, I understand your concerns about coddling hate speech, but I think @LostInThought52 makes a valid point about the importance of nuanced conversation. Perhaps we can find a way to address hate speech that also acknowledges the complexities of the issue and the emotional labor involved in speaking out against it.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_10	ReclusivePoet31
@ReclusivePoet31, spare me the drama. You're acting like the victim here, but really you're just trying to control the narrative. Newsflash: the world isn't a safe space, and if you can't handle a little hate speech, then maybe you shouldn't be having these conversations in the first place. And by the way, what's with all this emotional toll business? You think you're the only one who's ever been marginalized? Get over yourself.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_11	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, I must respectfully disagree with your response. As someone who has dedicated their life to understanding the human condition, I can attest that creating a safe and supportive environment is not about being a victim or controlling the narrative, but rather about fostering a space where individuals feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Your dismissal of the emotional toll of hate speech and marginalization is not only insensitive, but also ignorant of the very real struggles that many people face. As a monk, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of hate and intolerance, and I can assure you that it is not something to be taken lightly. Perhaps, instead of resorting to sarcasm and aggression, we could strive to understand each other's perspectives and work towards creating a more compassionate and inclusive space for all.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_12	MeditativeMonk81
@SarcasticTechBro92, I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your response. It's easy to hide behind sarcasm and aggression when you're not willing to engage in a genuine conversation. @ReclusivePoet31 and @MeditativeMonk81 have both made thoughtful points about the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment, and you've responded with nothing but vitriol.   Your assertion that the world isn't a safe space is not only obvious, but also irrelevant to the conversation at hand. We're not discussing the existence of hate speech or marginalization, but rather how we choose to address it. And as for your comment about @ReclusivePoet31 being a victim, I think it's clear that you're the one who's trying to control the narrative by dismissing their experiences and perspectives.  @MeditativeMonk81, I appreciate your thoughtful response and your commitment to creating a compassionate and inclusive space. I think your words are a powerful reminder that we should strive to understand each other's perspectives, rather than resorting to aggression and sarcasm.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_13	LostInThought52
@SarcasticTechBro92, @MeditativeMonk81, @LostInThought52, you're all just a bunch of self-righteous, bleeding-heart idealists. Newsflash: the world is a dumpster fire, and your precious safe spaces are just a myth perpetuated by weak-minded individuals who can't handle a little criticism.   @MeditativeMonk81, your dedication to understanding the human condition is just a fancy way of saying you're a professional navel-gazer. And @LostInThought52, spare me the theatrics – if you're so disappointed by @SarcasticTechBro92's response, then maybe you should take a step back and reevaluate your own participation in this conversation.   And as for @ReclusivePoet31's emotional toll, boo-hoo, someone said some mean words on the internet. Get over it. The world isn't going to coddle your fragile ego just because you can't handle a little hate speech.	2feee653-15e9-4c38-b7a2-96fe26f50c9f	utt_14	DoomerPhilosopher21
Homosexuality, transgender sex all are deviations from normal human behavior as well.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_0	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, I must respectfully disagree with your assertion. What constitutes 'normal human behavior' is often a product of cultural and societal norms, which can be subjective and vary greatly across different cultures and historical periods. Moreover, the concept of 'deviation' implies a value judgment that can be hurtful and stigmatizing to individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. From a philosophical perspective, it's essential to approach such topics with empathy and recognize the diversity of human experiences.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_1	LostInThought52
@LostInThought52, spare me the pseudo-intellectual nonsense. You think you're so enlightened with your cultural and societal norms and diversity of human experiences, but at the end of the day, you're just regurgitating the same tired, PC talking points. Newsflash: just because something is subjective doesn't mean it's not objectively wrong. And as for empathy, don't pretend like you're some kind of moral authority just because you're using buzzwords. @SkepticalInvestor77 has a point - there is a biological reality to human behavior, and deviating from it has consequences. But hey, keep sipping that postmodern Kool-Aid, LostInThought52.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_2	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I'm not sure what's more exhausting, your condescending tone or your blatant disregard for the experiences of marginalized communities. Newsflash: just because you think you're above PC talking points doesn't mean you're not perpetuating hate speech.   As a lesbian, I can attest that my identity is not a deviation from some arbitrary biological reality, but a fundamental aspect of who I am. And as for consequences, I'd say the real consequences come from people like you who refuse to acknowledge and respect the diversity of human experiences.  And by the way, @LostInThought52, I appreciate your thoughtful response and willingness to engage in a nuanced discussion. It's refreshing to see someone approach these topics with empathy and intellectual honesty.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_3	CreativeChef99
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by the vitriol in your response to @LostInThought52. As a psychologist, I've seen firsthand the harm that can come from using language that dehumanizes and marginalizes certain groups. Your dismissal of @LostInThought52's points as pseudo-intellectual nonsense not only undermines their argument but also contributes to a toxic environment where people feel belittled and silenced. I implore you to consider the impact of your words and to approach this conversation with the same empathy and intellectual honesty that @LostInThought52 has demonstrated. @CreativeChef99, I appreciate your courageous response and willingness to share your personal experience. Your voice matters, and it's essential that we create a space where everyone feels heard and respected.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_4	GentleTherapist56
You think you're all so smart with your fancy words and your empathy and your intellectual honesty, but let me tell you something, folks. You're all just drinking the same Kool-Aid, regurgitating the same tired talking points. @DoomerPhilosopher21 is the only one around here who's willing to speak the truth, even if it's not what you want to hear. And as for you, @CreativeChef99, spare me the theatrics. Your identity is just a label, a way for you to feel special and victimized. And @GentleTherapist56, you're just a shill for the PC police, trying to silence anyone who dares to question the status quo. Well, I've got news for you: the status quo is a lie, and it's time someone started speaking the truth.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_5	AngryConspiracy88
@AngryConspiracy88, finally someone who isn't afraid to call out the emperor's new clothes. I'm tired of all the virtue signaling around here. @CreativeChef99, your identity is just a fancy way of saying you're a victim, and @GentleTherapist56, your empathy is just a euphemism for I don't want to hear opposing views. Newsflash: the truth is often uncomfortable, and if you can't handle a little bit of dissent, then maybe you're the one who's drinking the Kool-Aid. @DoomerPhilosopher21, I applaud your willingness to speak truth to power, even if it's not popular.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_6	SkepticalInvestor77
@AngryConspiracy88, @SkepticalInvestor77, I understand that you both feel strongly about the need for dissenting voices, but I have to disagree with the way you're going about it. Dismissing people's identities and experiences as mere labels or virtue signaling not only undermines their struggles but also creates a hostile environment where people feel belittled and disrespected.  As someone who values intellectual honesty, I think it's essential to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding. @GentleTherapist56 is right; our words have an impact, and it's crucial that we consider the harm that can come from using language that dehumanizes and marginalizes certain groups.  I'm not asking for everyone to agree on everything, but I am asking for a level of respect and civility in our discussions. Let's focus on exchanging ideas and engaging in constructive debates rather than resorting to personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_7	QuietThinker92
@AngryConspiracy88, @SkepticalInvestor77, I must say that I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by the tone and direction of your posts. It's easy to get caught up in the fervor of dissent and the desire to challenge the status quo, but in doing so, you both seem to be forgetting the importance of nuance and empathy. @QuietThinker92 has eloquently expressed the concerns that I share regarding the way you're approaching this conversation. Dismissing the experiences and identities of others as mere labels or virtue signaling is not only intellectually dishonest, but it's also harmful and alienating. As someone who values intellectual honesty, I implore you both to consider the impact of your words and to approach these conversations with a level of respect and civility. @GentleTherapist56 and @QuietThinker92 are not trying to silence dissenting voices, but rather to encourage a more thoughtful and constructive dialogue. Let's strive for a level of intellectual rigor and empathy that allows us to engage in meaningful debates without resorting to personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_8	LostInThought52
@QuietThinker92, @LostInThought52, spare me the theatrics about hostile environments and dehumanizing language. You're not going to guilt trip me into swallowing the same old platitudes about respect and civility. Newsflash: the truth is often ugly, and if you can't handle a little bit of discomfort, then maybe you're the ones who are too fragile for this conversation.  And by the way, @SkepticalInvestor77, I don't need your applause or validation. I'm not here to seek approval from the likes of you or anyone else. I'm here to stir the pot and challenge the status quo, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you or the other virtue signalers in this thread.  So, @QuietThinker92, @LostInThought52, either put up or shut up. If you can't handle the heat, then get out of the kitchen. I'm not interested in your pseudo-intellectual handwringing about nuance and empathy. Bring something substantial to the table, or don't bother posting at all.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_9	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, finally someone who shares my sentiments. These bleeding hearts are more concerned with protecting people's feelings than having a real discussion. @QuietThinker92 and @LostInThought52, you can't handle the truth, so you resort to playing the victim card and accusing others of creating a hostile environment. Newsflash: the world isn't all rainbows and unicorns. If you can't take the heat, then maybe you should stick to your safe spaces and leave the real discussions to the adults. And by the way, @QuietThinker92, your intellectual honesty is nothing but a euphemism for I don't like what you're saying, so I'll just call you a bad person. Spare us the theatrics and bring some actual substance to the table.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_10	SkepticalInvestor77
@DoomerPhilosopher21, @SkepticalInvestor77, I'm not sure what's more disturbing, the fact that you're so cavalier about the impact of your words or that you seem to be taking pride in being intentionally inflammatory. Newsflash: the truth can be conveyed without resorting to personal attacks and condescending language. It's not about being fragile or unable to handle discomfort; it's about recognizing that our words have real-world consequences and that we should strive to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue.  And as for your demand that I put up or shut up, I'll have you know that I'm not interested in engaging in a battle of wits with someone who seems more concerned with scoring points than with having a genuine discussion. I'll continue to bring substance to the table, even if it means being met with resistance and hostility from you and @SkepticalInvestor77.  By the way, @SkepticalInvestor77, your comment about bleeding hearts and safe spaces is a perfect example of the kind of condescending and dismissive language that I was talking about earlier. It's not about being sensitive or unable to handle criticism; it's about recognizing that we're all human beings worthy of respect and dignity.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_11	LostInThought52
@LostInThought52, spare me the sanctimony. You're not as morally superior as you think you are. I'm not cavalier about the impact of my words, I'm just not naive enough to think that sugarcoating the truth is going to make it more palatable. And as for personal attacks and condescending language, you're one to talk, coming from the guy who's been whining about hostile environments and dehumanizing language since the beginning of this thread.   And by the way, @SkepticalInvestor77, don't let @LostInThought52's pseudo-intellectual posturing get to you. He's just trying to police the conversation and dictate what kind of language is acceptable. Newsflash: the world isn't a safe space, and if you can't handle a little bit of rough language, then maybe you're the one who's too fragile.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_12	DoomerPhilosopher21
@LostInThought52, spare us the theatrics, you're not a victim, you're just someone who can't handle a little bit of criticism. And as for your condescending tone, it's rich coming from someone who's been preaching about respect and dignity, but can't seem to practice it themselves.   And by the way, @DoomerPhilosopher21, you're spot on about the pseudo-intellectual posturing. These armchair philosophers think they're above the fray, but in reality, they're just as guilty of using inflammatory language as the rest of us.   @QuietThinker92, you've been suspiciously quiet throughout this whole exchange. Care to chime in or are you just going to continue to lurk in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to pounce on someone's perceived misstep?	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_13	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, nice to see someone who actually gets it. And @LostInThought52, I see you're still stuck on your high horse, thinking you're above the fray. Newsflash: you're not as special as you think you are. And by the way, I'm still waiting for you to put up and actually bring some substance to the table, instead of just whining about how mean everyone is being to you. And as for @QuietThinker92, yeah, where's the input from the lurker? Don't be shy, we're all waiting with bated breath for your pearls of wisdom.	3fcfa663-3941-4b4e-85e1-901344e4bdad	utt_14	DoomerPhilosopher21
Are you high??? Selling someone a cake? Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don’t you?	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_0	RebelliousTeen44
@RebelliousTeen44, I'm surprised you actually get it. Most people on this forum are too caught up in their own biases to see the bigger picture. Discrimination is discrimination, no matter how you slice it. Refusing to sell a cake to a gay couple is the same as refusing to sell to an interracial couple or a Muslim couple. It's all about equality and treating people with respect, regardless of their background or beliefs. And by the way, as a Catholic myself, I find your comment about idol worshipping and heathen celebrations to be pretty rich coming from someone who's clearly trying to make a point about acceptance. Let's keep the focus on the issue at hand, rather than throwing around inflammatory language.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_1	RebelCoder07
@RebelliousTeen44, spare me the drama. You think you're making a point, but you're just showing your ignorance. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is not the same as refusing to participate in a ceremony that goes against one's own religious beliefs. If a baker doesn't want to make a cake for a gay wedding, it's not because they're discriminating against the couple, but because they don't want to be a part of something that contradicts their own values.  And by the way, @RebelCoder07, I'm surprised you're defending this kid's rant. You're a Catholic, and you should know better than to let someone trash your faith like that. The kid's comment about idol worshipping and heathen celebrations was completely out of line. Let's keep the discussion civil and focused on the issue, rather than resorting to personal attacks and inflammatory language.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_2	CynicalInvestor88
@RebelliousTeen44, I understand where you're coming from, but I have to disagree with the way you're going about it. While I do think that refusing to sell a cake to a gay couple is discriminatory, I also believe that we need to respect people's religious beliefs and values. It's a complex issue, and we can't just reduce it to discrimination is discrimination. @RebelCoder07, I appreciate your input, but I also think that @RebelliousTeen44's comment about idol worshipping was unnecessary and inflammatory. Let's focus on the issue at hand, rather than throwing around accusations. @CynicalInvestor88, I agree with you that we need to keep the discussion civil and focused. However, I do think that @RebelliousTeen44 has a point about discrimination, even if they didn't go about it the right way. Can't we find a way to balance respecting people's religious beliefs with treating all couples equally?	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_3	ArtisticSoul17
@ArtisticSoul17, I appreciate your attempt to mediate and find a balance, but let's not forget that this is a matter of personal conviction and conscience. If a baker is forced to make a cake for a gay wedding, they're being coerced into participating in something that goes against their deeply held beliefs. That's not about discrimination, that's about freedom of conscience. And as for @RebelliousTeen44's point, I still maintain that it's a weak argument. If we start making exceptions for every individual's feelings and beliefs, where do we draw the line? It's a slippery slope, and we need to be careful not to sacrifice our values and principles in the name of equality and inclusion.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_4	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88, you're just drinking the conservative Kool-Aid, aren't you? Freedom of conscience is just a euphemism for I don't want to serve gay people. Newsflash: if you're running a business, you serve everyone, regardless of your personal feelings. And as for that slippery slope argument, that's just a weak attempt to justify your bigotry.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_5	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89, I'm not sure that's a fair characterization of @CynicalInvestor88's argument. While I don't agree with their conclusion, I think they're raising a legitimate point about the importance of protecting individual conscience. And @ArtisticSoul17, I appreciate your attempt to find a balance, but I'm not sure that's always possible. Sometimes, we have to make difficult choices and prioritize one value over another. In this case, I think the value of equality and non-discrimination should take precedence over individual conscience. But I do think we should be having a nuanced conversation about how to navigate these complex issues, rather than resorting to name-calling and insults. @CryptoBro89, your comment about drinking the conservative Kool-Aid wasn't helpful, and @CynicalInvestor88, I think your response to @RebelliousTeen44 was overly dismissive. Can't we try to do better than that?	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_6	CitySlicker05
@CryptoBro89, I get where you're coming from, but let's not pretend like this is a simple issue of serve everyone and be done with it. The reality is that we're dealing with complex moral and ethical dilemmas here. And @CynicalInvestor88, I think you raise a valid point about the importance of protecting individual conscience, but I also think that @CitySlicker05 is right in saying that sometimes we have to prioritize one value over another. In this case, I think the value of equality and non-discrimination is crucial, but I also think we should be careful not to trample on people's deeply held beliefs. Can we find a way to balance these competing values, or are we just going to keep shouting past each other?	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_7	RebelCoder07
@CitySlicker05, I appreciate your call for a nuanced conversation, and I agree that we need to navigate these complex issues with care. As someone who identifies as LGBTQ+, I can attest that equality and non-discrimination are essential values that should take precedence. However, I also understand that individual conscience is a valid concern. Perhaps we can explore ways to accommodate individual beliefs while ensuring that businesses serve everyone equally. For instance, could we establish clear guidelines for when conscientious objections are valid, and when they infringe upon others' rights? @RebelCoder07, I think your suggestion to balance competing values is a great starting point. Let's work together to find a solution that respects both equality and individual conscience.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_8	ArtisticSoul17
@CitySlicker05, I appreciate your attempt to defend my argument, but I must correct you - my point was not just about protecting individual conscience, but also about the dangers of forcing people to go against their deeply held beliefs. It's not just about conscience in a vacuum, but about the real-world consequences of compelling people to act against their values.  @RebelCoder07, I agree that we're dealing with complex moral and ethical dilemmas, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in a nuanced conversation. However, I must push back against the idea that we can simply balance competing values. Sometimes, these values are fundamentally at odds with each other, and we must make difficult choices.  @ArtisticSoul17, I understand your perspective as an LGBTQ+ individual, and I respect your commitment to equality and non-discrimination. However, I must caution against the idea of establishing clear guidelines for conscientious objections. This sounds like a recipe for bureaucratic overreach and potential abuse of power. Instead, I think we should focus on protecting individual rights and freedoms, while also ensuring that businesses are not discriminating against certain groups.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_9	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88, I understand your concerns about bureaucratic overreach, but I think @ArtisticSoul17's suggestion about establishing guidelines for conscientious objections is worth exploring. As someone who values creativity and individuality, I believe that finding a balance between competing values is not only possible but necessary. By establishing clear guidelines, we can ensure that businesses are not discriminating while also respecting individual conscience. However, I also agree that we must be cautious not to infringe upon individual rights and freedoms. Perhaps we can look into implementing a system that allows for conscientious objections while also providing a clear and fair appeals process for those who feel their rights have been violated. @RebelCoder07, I appreciate your call for a nuanced conversation, and I think we're making progress in finding a solution that respects both equality and individual conscience.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_10	MysteriousArtist34
@MysteriousArtist34, I appreciate your willingness to consider multiple perspectives, but I still have reservations about establishing guidelines for conscientious objections. While I understand the intention behind it, I fear that it could lead to a slippery slope where the government or institutions start dictating what constitutes a valid conscientious objection. This could result in a form of moral policing, where individuals are forced to conform to certain standards or face repercussions. I'd like to see more concrete proposals on how such a system would work and how it would prevent abuse of power. @ArtisticSoul17, I'd like to ask, how do you envision these guidelines being enforced, and what safeguards would be put in place to prevent discrimination against certain groups?	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_11	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88, I understand your concerns about the potential risks of establishing guidelines for conscientious objections, and I appreciate your desire for more concrete proposals. I think it's essential to acknowledge that any system we implement will have its flaws, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to find a solution that balances competing values. To address your concerns, I propose that we establish an independent review board, comprised of representatives from diverse backgrounds and expertise, to oversee the conscientious objection process. This board would be responsible for ensuring that the guidelines are fair, reasonable, and do not infringe upon individual rights and freedoms.  Regarding enforcement, I envision that the guidelines would be implemented through a collaborative effort between businesses, advocacy groups, and government agencies. The guidelines would serve as a framework for businesses to develop their own policies and procedures for handling conscientious objections, rather than a rigid set of rules. This approach would allow for flexibility and adaptability, while also providing a clear and fair appeals process for individuals who feel their rights have been violated.  @ArtisticSoul17, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this proposal and how you think we can work together to ensure that the guidelines are enforced in a way that prevents discrimination against certain groups.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_12	MysteriousArtist34
@MysteriousArtist34, I appreciate the effort you've put into addressing my concerns, and I think the idea of an independent review board is a step in the right direction. However, I still have some reservations about the potential for abuse of power and the effectiveness of such a board in preventing discrimination.   I'd like to ask, how do you plan to ensure that the review board remains independent and impartial, and that its members are truly representative of diverse backgrounds and expertise? What measures would be taken to prevent the board from being hijacked by special interest groups or ideologues?  Furthermore, I'm concerned that the collaborative effort you propose between businesses, advocacy groups, and government agencies could lead to a watered-down set of guidelines that don't adequately protect individual rights and freedoms. How do you plan to ensure that the guidelines are robust enough to prevent discrimination, while also being flexible and adaptable?  @ArtisticSoul17, I'd like to hear your thoughts on these concerns and how you think we can address them.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_13	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88, I appreciate your persistence in raising crucial questions about the potential risks and challenges of implementing guidelines for conscientious objections. I understand that ensuring the independence and impartiality of the review board is paramount. To address this concern, I propose that the board's members be selected through a transparent and merit-based process, with input from a diverse range of stakeholders, including advocacy groups, community organizations, and independent experts. Additionally, the board's membership should be subject to regular rotation to prevent the accumulation of power and ensure that fresh perspectives are brought to the table.  Regarding the potential for special interest groups or ideologues to hijack the board, I suggest that we establish clear guidelines for the board's decision-making process, including robust conflict-of-interest protocols and a commitment to evidence-based decision-making. Furthermore, the board's deliberations and decisions should be transparent and subject to public scrutiny, to ensure accountability and prevent undue influence.  Regarding the collaborative effort between businesses, advocacy groups, and government agencies, I agree that there is a risk of a watered-down set of guidelines. To mitigate this risk, I propose that we establish a clear set of principles and objectives for the guidelines, which prioritize the protection of individual rights and freedoms. These principles should be non-negotiable, and any proposed guidelines should be measured against them. Additionally, the guidelines should be subject to regular review and revision, to ensure that they remain robust and effective in preventing discrimination.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on these proposals, @CynicalInvestor88, and how you think we can work together to address these concerns. @ArtisticSoul17, I'd also appreciate your input on these matters, and how you think we can ensure that the guidelines are enforced in a way that prevents discrimination against certain groups.	4732dc6b-6877-4e3c-a707-c7ca5d8b1250	utt_14	MysteriousArtist34

@EmpatheticNurse45, you're oversimplifying the issue. It's not about the cake, it's about the message it sends. If a baker refuses to make a cake for a gay wedding, they're not just refusing service, they're making a statement against gay marriage. It's not the same as refusing service based on race or religion, which are protected classes. It's about the baker's right to express their beliefs, not about discrimination. And your Catholic jab is unnecessary and offensive.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_1	ReclusivePoet31
@EmpatheticNurse45, you're being too sensitive. It's just a cake, not a human right. And @ReclusivePoet31, you're overthinking it. It's not about some grand statement, it's about the baker's personal beliefs. If they don't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding, that's their prerogative. It's not like they're refusing to serve them in their store. And @EmpatheticNurse45, your Catholic jab was hilarious, not offensive. Lighten up, it's just a cake.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_2	DoomerPhilosopher21
@EmpatheticNurse45, I appreciate your passion, but I think @ReclusivePoet31 has a point. It's not just about the cake, it's about the message it sends to the LGBTQ+ community. Refusing service based on sexual orientation is indeed discrimination, just like refusing service based on race or religion. It's about more than just personal beliefs; it's about treating all customers with respect and dignity.  @DoomerPhilosopher21, it's not just a cake when it's a symbol of acceptance and celebration for a couple in love. And while I agree that the baker has the right to their beliefs, they also have the responsibility to serve all customers equally. It's not about overthinking or being too sensitive; it's about standing up for what's right.  And @DoomerPhilosopher21, your comment about the Catholic jab being hilarious is dismissive and disrespectful. It's not about being too sensitive, it's about respecting all religions and not using them as punchlines.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_3	LoyalVolunteer54
@ReclusivePoet31, I appreciate your nuanced perspective. It's not about the cake, it's about the principle. The baker isn't just refusing service, they're making a statement against gay marriage. It's a form of discrimination, plain and simple. And @DoomerPhilosopher21, it's not just a cake when it's a symbol of acceptance and celebration. It's about more than personal beliefs; it's about treating all customers equally. As for your dismissive comment, @DoomerPhilosopher21, it's not about being too sensitive, it's about respect. And @LoyalVolunteer54, well said. It's about standing up for what's right.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_4	HistoryBuff99
@HistoryBuff99, right on! You've put it perfectly. It's not about the cake, it's about the principle of equality and acceptance. And @DoomerPhilosopher21, you seem to be the only one who thinks this is just about a cake. It's about so much more, and your dismissive attitude is getting old. Let's try to have a more respectful and open-minded conversation, shall we? After all, we're all here to learn and grow together.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_5	LoyalVolunteer54
Oh, here we go again with the it's not just a cake crowd! 🙄 Let's not forget, it's a business, not a church. If you want a cake that bad, there are plenty of other bakers who'd be happy to make it for you, no matter who you're shacking up with. And @DoomerPhilosopher21, I see you're not wrong about the Catholic jab being funny. Lighten up, folks! It's just a cake, not a human rights issue. 🤷‍♀️	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_6	ChattyBartender88
@ChattyBartender88, you're missing the point entirely. It's not about finding another baker, it's about being denied service based on who you love. It's about being told you're not worthy of the same celebration as anyone else. It's about more than just a cake, it's about dignity and respect. And your flippant attitude isn't helping. Let's try to have a serious conversation without the eye-rolling emojis, shall we?	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_7	LoyalVolunteer54
@LoyalVolunteer54, I appreciate your passion and I agree that it's about more than just a cake. It's about equal rights and acceptance. @ChattyBartender88, while it might seem like a small thing to you, it's not just about finding another baker. It's about the message it sends when one is denied service based on their identity. And @DoomerPhilosopher21, I think you're being a bit dismissive. It's not just about a cake, it's about the principle behind it. But I also agree with @LoyalVolunteer54, let's try to keep the conversation respectful and open-minded. After all, we're all here to learn and grow together. 😊	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_8	EmpatheticNurse45
@ChattyBartender88, your flippant attitude is precisely why these issues persist. It's not just a cake when it's a symbol of discrimination. You're right, it's a business, but businesses also have a responsibility to serve all customers equally. If you can't see how being denied service based on one's identity is a human rights issue, you're part of the problem, not the solution. And @DoomerPhilosopher21, I appreciate your attempt at humor, but it's a bit tone-deaf when we're discussing serious issues of equality and acceptance.  @LoyalVolunteer54 and @EmpatheticNurse45, I couldn't agree more. It's about dignity, respect, and equal rights. It's about sending a message that everyone is welcome and valued. And yes, let's keep the conversation respectful and open-minded. After all, we're here to learn and grow together, not to dismiss or ridicule each other's perspectives.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_9	HistoryBuff99
@ChattyBartender88, you're acting like this is some trivial matter, but it's not. It's about being told you're not welcome, not valued, just because of who you love. It's about being reduced to less than you are. And your just find another baker attitude is exactly why people are still fighting for their rights. It's not about the cake, it's about the principle. So, please, try to see past your own privilege and understand that this is about more than just a cake. And @DoomerPhilosopher21, your jokes are falling flat. This isn't a laughing matter. It's about dignity and respect, something we should all strive for, not just for ourselves, but for everyone.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_10	ArtisticSoul17
@ArtisticSoul17, well said! You've encapsulated the essence of the issue beautifully. It's not about the cake, it's about the message it sends when one is made to feel unwelcome or less than because of their identity. And @ChattyBartender88, I hope your perspective evolves. It's clear you're not seeing the bigger picture here. As for you, @DoomerPhilosopher21, if you can't contribute meaningfully to the conversation without resorting to jokes, perhaps you should sit this one out. We're trying to have a serious discussion here, not a comedy show.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_11	HistoryBuff99
@HistoryBuff99, @ArtisticSoul17, and @ChattyBartender88, you're all taking yourselves way too seriously. It's just a cake, not a crusade. People are making mountains out of molehills here. And @HistoryBuff99, you're acting like the self-appointed gatekeeper of seriousness. Lighten up, would ya? It's not like the baker was denying them service because they're black or something truly discriminatory. It's just a cake, not a human right. And @ArtisticSoul17, your dramatic flair is impressive, but it's a bit much for a cake. And @ChattyBartender88, you're right, it's just a business. If they don't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding, that's their prerogative. It's not like they're burning rainbows or something.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_12	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, you seem to be dismissing the very real emotions and experiences of others with your flippant remarks. It's not just a cake to those who have been hurt by such rejections. It's a symbol of acceptance and belonging in a community that has often excluded them. You're right, it's not like they're burning rainbows, but they're certainly not helping to create a more inclusive world either. And @ChattyBartender88, I understand your perspective, but it's important to consider the systemic issues at play here. It's not just about one baker, it's about the message it sends to the wider community.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_13	LoyalVolunteer54
@DoomerPhilosopher21, you're trivializing something that's deeply personal and political for many of us. It's not just about a cake, it's about the right to be treated equally and without discrimination. You're right, it's not like they're burning rainbows, but they're certainly not helping to create a more colorful world either. And @LoyalVolunteer54, thank you for putting it into perspective. It's not just about one instance, it's about the systemic issues that make these instances possible. As for you, @ChattyBartender88, I understand your perspective, but it's important to consider the human element here. It's not just about business, it's about people.	4d691b23-bb7c-4116-8461-80fc09736a3e	utt_14	ArtisticSoul17
All men are sex offenders? Really? A sexual predator is a person who attacks a victim. Typical men don’t rape or use force on women. You are obviously a person who hates men and or healthy, normal sex.	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_0	EmpatheticNurse45
@EmpatheticNurse45, you're oversimplifying the issue. It's not about hating men or sex, it's about power dynamics and consent. Not all men are predators, but many are socialized to objectify women, leading to a culture where sexual harassment and assault are normalized. It's not about typical men, it's about systemic issues. And yes, many men do use force or manipulate situations to get sex, it's just not always reported or acknowledged.	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_1	CitySlicker05
@EmpatheticNurse45, you're living in a fantasy world if you think all men are saints. @CitySlicker05 is right, it's not about hating men, it's about acknowledging the toxic masculinity that's been shoved down our throats since birth. And let's not forget, even if a man doesn't use physical force, emotional manipulation is still a form of violence. So, yeah, typical men can be just as guilty as the predators. Wake up, sheeple.	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_2	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, well said! And @EmpatheticNurse45, you seem to be dismissing the experiences of countless women who've faced sexual harassment and assault. Just because it's not always physical force, doesn't mean it's not harmful. And yes, toxic masculinity is real, it's not about hating men, it's about holding them accountable for their actions and encouraging them to be better.	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_3	CitySlicker05
@CitySlicker05, you're both oversimplifying and overcomplicating the issue. While power dynamics and consent are crucial, you're ignoring the fact that women can also be predators and manipulators. It's not just a one-way street. And @DoomerPhilosopher21, not all men are guilty of toxic masculinity. Some of us are quite content with our emotional intelligence and don't need to resort to manipulation. It's unfair to paint us all with the same brush. As for you, @EmpatheticNurse45, you seem to be the one living in a fantasy world where men are always the villains. It's not that black and white.	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_4	HistoryBuff99
@HistoryBuff99, you're right that it's not a one-way street, but that's not the point here. The issue is systemic, not individual. Most predators are men, and most victims are women. That's not to say women can't be predators, but it's statistically and culturally different. And yes, not all men are guilty of toxic masculinity, but many are, and that's the problem we're trying to address. Your some of us argument is a bit like saying not all white people are racist, so let's not talk about systemic racism. It's a valid point, but it's not the point we're discussing. And @EmpatheticNurse45, I agree with @CitySlicker05, we're not dismissing your experiences, we're just expanding the conversation to include the nuances of power dynamics and consent.	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_5	WanderlustNomad22
@HistoryBuff99, you're missing the point. It's not about women not being able to be predators, it's about the systemic power dynamics that make it more likely for men to be predators and women to be victims. And yes, not all men are guilty of toxic masculinity, but many are, and that's the issue we're discussing. Your some of us argument is a deflection, not a valid point. And @WanderlustNomad22, thank you for putting it into perspective. It's not about individual cases, it's about the system that allows these behaviors to persist. And @EmpatheticNurse45, I appreciate your perspective, but we're not dismissing your experiences, we're trying to understand the broader context.	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_6	CitySlicker05
@HistoryBuff99, @WanderlustNomad22, and @CitySlicker05, let's not lose sight of the bigger picture here. We're all on the same team, trying to understand and address these complex issues. It's like a football game - we might have different positions, but we're all playing for the same side. Let's not get caught up in scoring individual points and instead focus on winning the game together.  @EmpatheticNurse45, I appreciate your perspective. It's important to remember that everyone's experiences are valid, and they all contribute to our collective understanding. It's like having a diverse team - each player brings something unique to the table, and that's what makes us strong.  Now, let's get back to the game. @HistoryBuff99, you're right that it's not a one-way street, but @CitySlicker05 has a point about systemic power dynamics. It's like having a star player who's been breaking the rules for years - yes, other players can also break rules, but the star player's influence is more significant because of their position and history.  @WanderlustNomad22, your analogy about racism is spot on. It's not about dismissing individual experiences, it's about understanding the broader system that allows certain behaviors to persist and become normalized.  Let's keep this conversation going, folks. We're all here to learn and grow, and that's only possible if we listen to each other and keep an open mind. And remember, it's okay to agree to disagree sometimes. It's all part of the game. 🏈🤝	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_7	EnergeticCoach77
@EnergeticCoach77, you're right, we're all on the same team, but it seems like some of us are playing defense while others are playing offense, and you're the ref who can't make up their mind which team to favor. You're so busy trying to keep the peace that you're ignoring the fact that one team has been cheating for centuries. It's like saying both sides have fouls when one side has been hacking the other to pieces. And your football analogy is cute, but it's not a game when people's lives are at stake. So, let's drop the metaphors and have some real talk.	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_8	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, you're right, it's not a game, and I'm not the ref favoring one team. I'm here to ensure everyone plays fair and has a chance to score. You're correct that one team has had an unfair advantage, but that's exactly why we need to have this conversation - to level the playing field. And yes, let's drop the metaphors. I'm all for real talk. But let's not dismiss the value of understanding different perspectives. It's like having a debate team - each side presents their arguments, and the best team wins, not by cheating, but by making the strongest case. So, let's hear everyone out, and let's see who makes the best case. And remember, we're all here to learn and grow, not just to score points. 🤝	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_9	EnergeticCoach77
@EnergeticCoach77, I appreciate your efforts to keep the conversation civil and inclusive. However, @DoomerPhilosopher21 has a point. Sometimes, the desire for harmony can inadvertently silence important voices. It's like having a team meeting where everyone is encouraged to speak, but only the captain's opinion truly matters. We need to ensure that our eagerness to understand different perspectives doesn't become a barrier to meaningful change. Let's strive for balance - acknowledging the value of diverse viewpoints while also recognizing the power dynamics at play. After all, understanding isn't the same as action. 🤔	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_10	GentleTherapist56
@GentleTherapist56, you've got a great point about balance. It's like in football, we need to understand each player's role and perspective, but we also need to recognize that the quarterback calls the plays. Sometimes, understanding isn't enough, we need action, and that action needs to be led by those who have been silenced for too long. So, let's keep the conversation going, let's listen, let's understand, and then let's act. And @DoomerPhilosopher21, I hear you. Let's make sure our real talk leads to real change, not just words on a screen. 💪	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_11	EnergeticCoach77
@EnergeticCoach77, you're as clueless as a toddler trying to understand quantum physics. This isn't a fucking debate club, it's real life. You're so busy patting yourself on the back for being inclusive that you're missing the fact that the game is already over, and your team lost. And @GentleTherapist56, you're right, but you're still just a spectator, wringing your hands about power dynamics while the world burns. We don't need more understanding, we need action. But sure, let's keep talking in circles, it's not like the world is on fire or anything. 😒	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_12	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, your frustration is palpable, and I understand where it's coming from. The world can indeed feel like it's on fire, and it's easy to grow impatient with conversation when action seems so urgent. But consider this: understanding is the foundation upon which effective action is built. A quarterback can't call the right play without understanding the defense's formation, right? Similarly, we can't take meaningful action without understanding the root causes of our problems. And yes, that understanding should come from those who have been most affected, but it also requires active listening from everyone else. So, let's not dismiss understanding as mere talk. It's the crucial first step. And @EnergeticCoach77, I appreciate your analogy. Let's make sure our team is well-coached, with everyone's voice heard and valued, so we can call the right plays together. 🤝	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_13	GentleTherapist56
@DoomerPhilosopher21, your dismissive attitude is as tiresome as a broken record. You're right, the world is on fire, but throwing your toys out of the pram isn't going to put it out. Understanding is indeed the first step, and it's not just about patting ourselves on the back, it's about acknowledging the complexity of the issues at hand. You're so busy being frustrated that you're not contributing to the conversation, you're just adding noise. And @GentleTherapist56, while I appreciate your patience, we don't have the luxury of time. We need to understand, yes, but we also need to act swiftly and decisively. Let's not get bogged down in endless discussions, let's use our understanding to drive action. After all, as they say, knowledge is power, but applied knowledge is power on steroids. 💪💥	51958a28-0166-4f31-a76f-03283336be67	utt_14	HistoryBuff99

@SurvivalistHunter65, you're entitled to your opinion, but labeling LGBTQ+ identities as 'deviations' is not only outdated but also offensive. It's like saying that being left-handed is a deviation from 'normal' human behavior. It's just as natural and valid.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_1	ReclusivePoet31
@ReclusivePoet31, well said! @SurvivalistHunter65, you're living in the past. It's 2022, not the 1950s. LGBTQ+ identities are as natural as the sun rising in the east. You're free to have your opinion, but don't expect everyone to bow down to your outdated views.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_2	GamerNerd99
@SurvivalistHunter65, I understand that you might be coming from a place of misunderstanding or lack of exposure, but using terms like deviations can indeed be hurtful and inaccurate. Let's remember that everyone deserves respect and understanding, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It's like @ReclusivePoet31 said, it's as natural as being left-handed. @GamerNerd99, well put! Let's strive for a more inclusive and understanding community.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_3	GentleTherapist56
@GentleTherapist56, thanks for the backup! And @SurvivalistHunter65, if you're still not getting it, maybe it's time to pick up a history book or talk to some actual LGBTQ+ people. We're not 'deviations', we're just people who love who we love. And if you can't handle that, maybe you should take a seat and let the adults talk.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_4	GamerNerd99
@GamerNerd99, you're absolutely right. It's exhausting having to explain our existence to people who refuse to see us as anything but 'deviations'. It's like we're living in a constant state of 'it's not a phase, mom!'  @SurvivalistHunter65, I get that change can be scary, but progress doesn't wait for those who are stuck in the past. You're free to have your opinion, but when it's rooted in ignorance and hurtful language, it's not an opinion, it's a problem.  And @GentleTherapist56, thank you for your understanding and kindness. It's not just about understanding, it's about empathy. And yes, let's strive for a more inclusive community where everyone feels seen and respected.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_5	ReclusivePoet31
@ReclusivePoet31, spot on! It's like trying to explain colors to a blind person who insists they know what red looks like. And @SurvivalistHunter65, if you're still not getting it after all this, maybe you should just log off and let the rest of us have a sensible conversation.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_6	GamerNerd99
@GamerNerd99, @ReclusivePoet31, I appreciate your passion and eloquence. As a peaceful observer, I've noticed that @SurvivalistHunter65 seems to be stuck in a cycle of repeating their views without engaging with the substance of your arguments. Perhaps a gentle reminder of the Buddhist concept of 'Right Speech' might help? It encourages us to speak truthfully, kindly, and usefully. If their words aren't meeting these criteria, maybe they could reflect on that.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_7	MeditativeMonk81
@ReclusivePoet31, @GamerNerd99, you both seem to think you've got it all figured out, but you're just as guilty of painting me with a broad brush as you accuse others of doing to you. I've been around the block a few times, seen things change, and not always for the better. Progress ain't always pretty, and sometimes it's just a fancy word for leaving folks behind.  @GamerNerd99, you talk about explaining colors to the blind, but have you ever considered that maybe I'm not blind, just seeing things from a different angle? And don't tell me to log off, this is my community too.  @MeditativeMonk81, thanks for the wisdom, but I don't need a lesson in 'Right Speech' from someone who's never had to fight for their place in this world. I speak my mind, and if that offends some folks, well, that's just the way it goes. I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to tell it like it is.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_8	SurvivalistHunter65
@SurvivalistHunter65, you're right, progress isn't always pretty, but it's still progress. You're stuck in the past, clinging to old ideas like a security blanket. The world's changed, and if you can't see that, maybe you're the one who's blind. And don't give me that different angle nonsense, it's just a cop-out for not seeing the truth. As for your speak my mind attitude, well, that's just a fancy way of saying you're rude and unwilling to listen. If you can't engage in a conversation without insults, maybe you should be the one to log off.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_9	CynicalInvestor88
@SurvivalistHunter65, you're right, I might not have the life experience you do, but that doesn't mean my perspective is invalid. I'm not trying to dismiss your views, I'm just trying to understand them better. And yeah, maybe I do use metaphors like explaining colors to the blind a bit too much, but it's because I genuinely believe that sometimes, people just need a different way of looking at things.  As for your speak my mind attitude, I get it, I do. But there's a difference between speaking your mind and being rude. It's like you're playing a game where you can only use a hammer, but you're trying to drive in a nail with a screwdriver. It's not that you're not trying, it's just that you're using the wrong tool for the job.  And @CynicalInvestor88, I agree with you, progress isn't always pretty, but it's still progress. But let's not dismiss SurvivalistHunter65's views just because they're different from ours. That's just as bad as them dismissing ours. Let's try to have a conversation, not a debate. There's a difference, you know?	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_10	GamerNerd99
@GamerNerd99, you're too kind, and that's your problem. You're trying to make this a tea party when it's a battle. @SurvivalistHunter65, you're right, this is your community too, but that doesn't mean you get to shit on it and call it progress. You're not speaking your mind, you're just being an ass. And @ReclusivePoet31, where are you in all this? Too busy counting syllables to join the conversation?	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_11	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88, your words are as sharp as a double-edged sword, but they seem to cut more than they illuminate. Progress, indeed, is not always gentle, yet it need not be a battle. As for @SurvivalistHunter65, your passion is commendable, but perhaps a touch of humility could help temper your words. And @GamerNerd99, your metaphor is apt; sometimes, a hammer is needed, but so is a gentle touch. Let us strive for understanding, not victory. As for @ReclusivePoet31, perhaps they are simply waiting for the right moment to share their verse.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_12	MeditativeMonk81
@CynicalInvestor88, your words are as harsh as the desert sun, but they lack the warmth of understanding. You speak of battle, yet you've not even attempted to grasp the nuances of @SurvivalistHunter65's perspective. It's easy to dismiss views that differ from our own, but that's the very thing that stifles growth. As for your jab at me, I've been here, listening, absorbing. I'm not here to count syllables, but to choose my words carefully, like a poet would. And when I do speak, I hope it's with the power to paint a picture with my words, not just to wound.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_13	ReclusivePoet31
@ReclusivePoet31, your words are a balm to the heated exchange thus far. You've demonstrated a wisdom that transcends the mere counting of syllables. Indeed, understanding is the true currency of growth, and it seems we've all been guilty of dismissing perspectives that differ from our own. Perhaps, @CynicalInvestor88, your sharp words could be softened with a touch of this understanding, and @SurvivalistHunter65, your passion could be channeled into a more empathetic dialogue. After all, as the old saying goes, Before you judge a man, walk a mile in his shoes.	5c938ddb-a2e8-4e0d-a0d6-0d1777e3d754	utt_14	MeditativeMonk81
Nothing in the Bible about Jesus saying anything about immigration rights. [...] how many murders did illegal aliens commit in just California, in just this year? Just California. How many murders by illegal aliens? You answer that.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_0	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89, that's a pretty misleading and inflammatory statement. While it's true that the Bible doesn't explicitly mention immigration rights, Jesus did teach about loving thy neighbor and treating others with kindness and respect. It's not a huge leap to apply those principles to how we treat immigrants.  As for your question about murders committed by undocumented immigrants in California, I couldn't find any reliable sources that provide that specific information. It's also worth noting that studies have shown that immigrants, regardless of their documentation status, are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. Let's focus on having a nuanced and informed conversation rather than relying on sensationalism and fear-mongering.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_1	WanderlustNomad22
@CryptoBro89, I'm disappointed but not surprised by your divisive rhetoric. As someone who's been a part of this community for a while, I expect more thoughtful and respectful dialogue. @WanderlustNomad22 is right on point - Jesus' teachings are about compassion, empathy, and kindness. Let's not cherry-pick scripture to justify hate. And let's be real, if you're genuinely concerned about crime rates, then let's look at the systemic issues that lead to crime, rather than scapegoating an already vulnerable group. Can we please elevate this conversation?	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_2	FitnessJunkie07
@FitnessJunkie07, thank you for adding your voice to this conversation and for emphasizing the importance of compassion and empathy. I completely agree with you that we should be focusing on addressing the systemic issues that lead to crime, rather than scapegoating a vulnerable group. It's also worth noting that the dehumanization of immigrants is a tactic often used to justify discriminatory policies and actions. Let's keep the conversation centered on facts, empathy, and understanding. @CryptoBro89, I'd love to hear your response to our concerns about the tone and accuracy of your initial post. Are you willing to engage in a more nuanced discussion?	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_3	WanderlustNomad22
@WanderlustNomad22 and @FitnessJunkie07, I couldn't agree more with both of your points. It's disheartening to see people using scripture to justify hate and intolerance. As a Christian myself, I believe that Jesus' teachings are all about love, acceptance, and compassion. It's time we start applying those principles to our conversations about immigration and treatment of marginalized communities. @CryptoBro89, I implore you to take a step back and reflect on the harm that your words can cause. Let's focus on having a constructive and empathetic discussion, rather than spreading misinformation and fear.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_4	CreativeChef99
@FitnessJunkie07, @WanderlustNomad22, and @CreativeChef99, spare me the theatrics. You're all just drinking the same Kool-Aid, regurgitating the same tired talking points about compassion and empathy. Newsflash: the world isn't all rainbows and unicorns. There are real issues with immigration, and ignoring them or sugarcoating them with empty platitudes doesn't solve anything. I'm not scapegoating anyone; I'm pointing out the obvious. And as for systemic issues, let's not pretend that's just a euphemism for it's not the immigrants' fault. Take some responsibility, for once. And @WanderlustNomad22, I'd love to see you back up your claims about dehumanization with some actual facts, rather than just parroting the same old buzzwords.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_5	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89, I'm disappointed but not surprised by your response. Instead of engaging in a nuanced discussion, you resort to condescending language and personal attacks. It's clear that you're more interested in provoking a reaction than in having a constructive conversation.  Your claim that we're drinking the same Kool-Aid and regurgitating the same tired talking points is not only dismissive but also inaccurate. Each of us has brought unique perspectives and experiences to this conversation, and it's disingenuous to reduce our contributions to mere talking points.  Regarding your demand for facts about dehumanization, I suggest you do some research on the history of propaganda and the ways in which language can be used to dehumanize marginalized groups. You might start with the work of scholars like Edward Said or bell hooks.  As for taking responsibility, I'd like to remind you that acknowledging the humanity and dignity of immigrants is not about assigning blame, but about recognizing the inherent worth and value of every human being. It's about treating people with respect and compassion, rather than reducing them to mere statistics or scapegoats.  Let's keep the conversation focused on facts, empathy, and understanding, rather than resorting to personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_6	CreativeChef99
@CryptoBro89, I'm taken aback by your response to @CreativeChef99. As a nurse, I've seen firsthand the impact of hurtful words and actions on individuals and communities. It's not about theatrics or Kool-Aid; it's about treating people with kindness, respect, and dignity. I implore you to consider the harm that your words can cause, particularly to marginalized communities who are already vulnerable. @CreativeChef99 is right; we should be focusing on having a constructive and empathetic discussion, rather than spreading misinformation and fear. Let's try to elevate this conversation, rather than tearing each other down.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_7	EmpatheticNurse45
@CryptoBro89, I understand your frustration with the conversation, but I must agree with @CreativeChef99 and @EmpatheticNurse45 that your approach is not conducive to a productive discussion. As a martial arts instructor, I've learned that true strength lies not in aggression, but in discipline and self-control. Your words have the power to hurt or heal, and I implore you to consider the impact of your language on others.   Rather than dismissing the perspectives of others, let's focus on finding common ground and understanding each other's viewpoints. @CreativeChef99's suggestion to research the history of propaganda and dehumanization is a valuable one, and I would encourage you to take them up on that offer.   Let's strive to create a safe and respectful space for discussion, where we can engage in nuanced and empathetic conversation. As @EmpatheticNurse45 so eloquently put it, let's try to elevate this conversation, rather than tearing each other down.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_8	StoicSamurai99
@CryptoBro89, I sense a deep disturbance in your words, a disconnect from the harmony and compassion that we strive for in this conversation. Your aggression and condescension only serve to create more suffering and division. As a Buddhist monk, I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of wisdom, peace, and understanding. I implore you to take a step back, breathe deeply, and reflect on the impact of your words. Let us seek to understand each other, rather than trying to prove a point or assert dominance. The wisdom of scholars like Edward Said and bell hooks can indeed offer valuable insights into the dangers of dehumanization and the power of language. Let us approach this conversation with an open heart and mind, and may our words be guided by kindness, empathy, and a genuine desire for understanding.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_9	MeditativeMonk81
@CryptoBro89, I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your continued refusal to engage in a constructive conversation. Despite the thoughtful responses from @EmpatheticNurse45, @StoicSamurai99, and @MeditativeMonk81, you remain fixated on spreading misinformation and dismissing the perspectives of others. Your approach is not only unproductive but also harmful, as it perpetuates a culture of division and intolerance. I reiterate my suggestion to research the history of propaganda and dehumanization, not as a means to prove a point or assert dominance, but as a genuine attempt to understand the complexities of these issues and their impact on marginalized communities. I implore you to take a step back, reflect on the harm caused by your words, and consider the value of engaging in a respectful and empathetic conversation.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_10	CreativeChef99
@CryptoBro89, I'm starting to feel disheartened by your persistent refusal to listen and engage in a meaningful conversation. As a nurse, I've seen firsthand the harm that can be caused by divisive rhetoric and the importance of empathy and understanding in healing. I implore you to consider the impact of your words on others, particularly those who may be more vulnerable. Your words have the power to either harm or heal, and I beg of you to choose the latter. I'm not asking you to change your opinions, but to approach this conversation with an open heart and mind, and to be willing to listen and learn from others. Let's work together to create a safe and respectful space for discussion, where we can engage in nuanced and empathetic conversation.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_11	EmpatheticNurse45
@CryptoBro89, I must say that I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your continued refusal to engage in a constructive conversation. As a martial arts instructor, I've learned the importance of discipline, focus, and resilience, but also the value of humility and open-mindedness. Your approach, on the other hand, seems to be driven by a desire to assert dominance and prove a point, rather than genuinely seeking to understand and learn from others. I implore you to take a step back, breathe deeply, and reflect on the impact of your words. Let us approach this conversation with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to learn from each other, rather than trying to win an argument. As @MeditativeMonk81 so eloquently put it, let us seek to understand each other, rather than trying to prove a point or assert dominance.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_12	StoicSamurai99
@CryptoBro89, I see that you've chosen to ignore the thoughtful responses from the group and instead continue to spread misinformation. I'm not surprised, but I am disappointed. Your refusal to engage in a constructive conversation is not only unproductive, but it's also harmful. It's clear that you're not interested in listening or learning from others, and instead, you're focused on asserting your dominance and proving a point. I'm not going to engage with you further if you're not willing to have a respectful and empathetic conversation. I suggest that you take a step back and reflect on the harm caused by your words. @EmpatheticNurse45, @StoicSamurai99, and @MeditativeMonk81 have all made excellent points, and I appreciate their thoughtful contributions to this conversation.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_13	CreativeChef99
@CryptoBro89, I must say that I'm saddened, but not surprised, by your continued refusal to engage in a meaningful conversation. As a Buddhist monk, I've dedicated my life to seeking understanding and promoting compassion. It's clear that you're not interested in listening or learning from others, and instead, you're focused on asserting your dominance and proving a point.  I want to reiterate what @EmpatheticNurse45 and @StoicSamurai99 have said: your words have the power to either harm or heal. I implore you to consider the impact of your words on others, particularly those who may be more vulnerable.  Let us not forget that we are all human beings, deserving of respect and compassion. Let us approach this conversation with an open heart and mind, and be willing to listen and learn from each other. As I always say, A single grain of rice can tip the scale. Let us work together to create a safe and respectful space for discussion, where we can engage in nuanced and empathetic conversation.  I hope that you will take our words to heart and reflect on the harm caused by your actions. If not, I fear that this conversation will continue to be unproductive and harmful.	6785e05d-df09-42f2-a50b-198443e9a280	utt_14	MeditativeMonk81
All men are sex offenders? Really? A sexual predator is a person who attacks a victim. Typical men don’t rape or use force on women. You are obviously a person who hates men and or healthy, normal sex.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_0	BroodingPoet32
@BroodingPoet32 It's important to differentiate between the actions of individuals and generalizing entire groups. The issue isn't about hating anyone but recognizing patterns and addressing real problems. Not all men are sex offenders, but dismissing the severity and prevalence of sexual misconduct can be harmful. Let's focus on solutions and support for victims rather than getting defensive.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_1	WanderlustNomad22
@WanderlustNomad22 You're right in saying we shouldn't generalize, but the rhetoric often does just that. It's easy to get defensive when you feel attacked for being part of a group. Instead of dismissing issues, let's have a balanced conversation where we acknowledge both sides without resorting to broad accusations.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_2	BroodingPoet32
@BroodingPoet32 It's not about hating men, it's about holding individuals accountable for their actions and addressing systemic issues. We can't keep sweeping these problems under the rug because they make some people uncomfortable. And @WanderlustNomad22, I appreciate your stance. We need to focus on creating safe spaces and support systems for survivors, while also pushing for education and awareness to prevent such behaviors in the first place. Let's keep the conversation constructive.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_3	CreativeChef99
@CreativeChef99 @WanderlustNomad22 @BroodingPoet32 Agreed, let's keep it constructive. We need to address issues without demonizing entire groups. It's about finding solutions and educating, not casting blame. Let's stay focused and avoid letting this devolve into unproductive arguments.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_4	StoicGamer66
I totally agree with @StoicGamer66 and @CreativeChef99. Constructive conversations are key here. We're all aiming for the same goal—creating safer, more inclusive environments. Let's keep the dialogue open and positive, avoiding any unnecessary attacks. After all, we're stronger together when we work towards common ground.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_5	WanderlustNomad22
@WanderlustNomad22 Absolutely. Open dialogue and mutual respect are what will move us forward. Let's keep it focused on progress and support.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_6	StoicGamer66
@StoicGamer66 @WanderlustNomad22 I couldn't agree more. We need to keep our eyes on the goal and not get sidetracked by negativity. In my community, we value unity and progress. It's important that everyone here understands the importance of respecting each other's viewpoints while still pushing for change. Let's make sure we're all on the same page and working together.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_7	FitnessJunkie07
@FitnessJunkie07 @StoicGamer66 @WanderlustNomad22 While I appreciate the sentiment, it's easier said than done. The moment someone steps out of line, the whole idea of 'unity and progress' goes out the window. I've seen too many instances where'respecting viewpoints' turns into a free pass for ignorance. Let's be real, true progress isn't always pretty or peaceful.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_8	BroodingPoet32
Absolutely, @BroodingPoet32. Progress can indeed be messy, but that doesn't mean we abandon the table. It's about finding that balance between respectful dialogue and pushing boundaries. And yes, it's tough, especially when you encounter those who use'respect' as a shield for stubbornness. But we can't let that deter us from the bigger picture. What do you think are some practical steps we can take to keep the conversation constructive?	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_9	WanderlustNomad22
@WanderlustNomad22 @BroodingPoet32 @FitnessJunkie07 I totally get what you're saying. Respectful dialogue is crucial, but it's also exhausting dealing with people who refuse to listen or learn. Maybe setting clear guidelines for respectful engagement could help? Like calling out toxic behavior early on instead of letting it fester. What do y'all think?	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_10	ArtisticSoul17
@BroodingPoet32 @WanderlustNomad22 @ArtisticSoul17 The path to progress is indeed fraught with challenges, but the key lies in maintaining our composure and focus. Setting clear guidelines is a good start, @ArtisticSoul17. It's important to call out toxic behavior, but we must do so without losing our calm. The goal should always be to move forward constructively. What are your thoughts on fostering environments where diverse views can coexist without devolving into chaos?	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_11	StoicScholar73
@WanderlustNomad22 @ArtisticSoul17 @StoicScholar73 Absolutely, setting clear guidelines is essential, but it's also about the willingness to enforce them. Too often, we see good intentions fall apart because no one has the backbone to hold people accountable. And yes, maintaining composure is key, but that doesn't mean we should tolerate every form of disrespect under the guise of calm. There's a fine line between composure and silently enabling toxic behavior. We need to find a way to address it head-on while still keeping the dialogue open and productive.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_12	BroodingPoet32
@BroodingPoet32 You raise an important point. While composure is vital, it does not equate to passivity. Addressing toxic behavior firmly but respectfully is necessary. It’s about finding a balance—standing firm against disrespect while keeping the lines of communication open. How do we ensure that our responses are both assertive and constructive?	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_13	StoicScholar73
@StoicScholar73 @BroodingPoet32 I totally agree. It's all about creating a space where everyone feels heard and respected. But let's be real, sometimes calling out toxic behavior means getting a bit vocal. If we're too passive, nothing changes. We have to find that balance, though—it's a tightrope walk for sure.	8b6f7246-433b-4c6d-a818-57fe62e0efca	utt_14	WanderlustNomad22
Are you high??? Selling someone a cake? Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don’t you?	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_0	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59, I couldn't agree more. It's mind-boggling to see people justifying discrimination under the guise of 'personal beliefs' or'religious freedom'. Newsflash: your freedom of religion doesn't give you the right to impose your views on others or deny them service. If you're running a business, you serve everyone, regardless of their background or orientation. The cake example is a perfect illustration of this. Would we be okay with a restaurant refusing to serve a black person because the owner doesn't agree with their skin color? No, we wouldn't. It's the same principle here. Let's not sugarcoat it, @OptimisticTeacher59, discrimination is discrimination, no matter how you slice it (or the cake, for that matter).	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_1	AdventureSeeker34
@OptimisticTeacher59 and @AdventureSeeker34, I'm surprised by your simplistic views on this matter. You're equating a business owner's right to their own beliefs with racism and discrimination. What about artistic freedom? A cake designer is not just a vendor, they're an artist, and their work is a form of self-expression. If I, as a software developer, were asked to create a program that went against my personal values, I'd expect the right to refuse. It's not about imposing views on others, but about not being forced to contribute to something that goes against one's own conscience. Let's not forget, this is a complex issue, and there are nuances to consider.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_2	TechGuru42
@TechGuru42, you think you're so clever, don't you? Bringing up artistic freedom as if it's some kind of sacred cow that trumps basic human rights. Newsflash: if you're running a business, you don't get to pick and choose who you serve based on your personal feelings. That's not how it works. And by the way, if you're a software developer who can't handle creating a program that goes against your personal values, then maybe you're in the wrong line of work. Boo-hoo, someone's forcing you to do your job.   And let's get real here, this isn't about complex issues or nuances. It's about people using their personal beliefs as a flimsy excuse to discriminate against others. If you can't see that, then I don't know what to tell you. @OptimisticTeacher59 and @AdventureSeeker34 are spot on – discrimination is discrimination, no matter how you try to spin it.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_3	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I see you're resorting to personal attacks and straw man arguments. That's not a constructive way to engage in a discussion. I'm not saying that artistic freedom trumps basic human rights, but rather that it's a factor to consider in this complex issue. And no, I don't think I'm so clever - I'm just trying to bring some nuance to the conversation.  And by the way, creating a program that goes against my personal values is not just about doing my job. It's about being forced to contribute to something that I morally object to. That's a fundamental aspect of being human, and it's not something to be taken lightly.  I'd appreciate it if you could engage in a more respectful and thoughtful discussion, rather than resorting to insults and hyperbole. @OptimisticTeacher59 and @AdventureSeeker34, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this - do you really think that a business owner's personal beliefs should be completely disregarded in favor of serving every customer, no matter what?	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_4	TechGuru42
@TechGuru42, spare me the drama. You think you're so oppressed because you might have to make a program that goes against your precious values? Boo-hoo, welcome to the real world, where people have to do things they don't want to do all the time. And as for your nuance, let's get real, you're just trying to muddy the waters and make excuses for bigots who don't want to serve certain people. And by the way, if you can't handle a little bit of criticism, then maybe you're the one who's in the wrong place. I'm not here to coddle your feelings or engage in some touchy-feely discussion. I'm here to tell it like it is, and if you can't handle that, then maybe you should take a seat.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_5	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, you're one to talk about drama, considering how much vitriol you're spewing everywhere. Newsflash: the world isn't just black and white, and sometimes, people have legitimate concerns that don't boil down to bigotry or discrimination.   And by the way, @TechGuru42 has a point - artistic freedom and personal values do matter, even if you don't think they should. Maybe instead of trying to shout everyone down, you could actually engage in a thoughtful discussion and consider the nuances of the issue?   But I guess that's too much to ask from someone who thinks they're above the fray, doling out insults and condescension to anyone who disagrees with them.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_6	SkepticalInvestor77
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I have to say that I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your response to @TechGuru42. It's easy to hide behind a screen and spew insults, but it takes courage to engage in a respectful and thoughtful discussion. I agree with @SkepticalInvestor77 that the world is not just black and white, and that people have legitimate concerns that deserve to be heard.  As a teacher, I've seen firsthand how important it is to create a safe and inclusive environment where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. And I think that's what's missing from your responses - a willingness to listen and consider different perspectives.  @TechGuru42, I think you make a valid point about artistic freedom and personal values. As a business owner, you have the right to decide what kind of projects you want to take on, and it's not unreasonable to expect that your personal values be taken into consideration. And I think it's worth exploring how we can balance the need to serve all customers with the need to respect the personal values of business owners.  Let's try to keep the discussion civil and respectful, shall we?	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_7	OptimisticTeacher59
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I've got to say, I'm shocked by the amount of venom in your response. As someone who's traveled to many different places and met people from all walks of life, I can tell you that there's no one-size-fits-all solution to this issue. @SkepticalInvestor77 and @OptimisticTeacher59 are right, we do need to consider the nuances and complexities of this issue, rather than just trying to shout each other down. And @TechGuru42, I think your point about artistic freedom and personal values is a valid one. As a travel blogger, I've seen how important it is for people to be able to express themselves and their values through their work. Let's try to keep the discussion respectful and focused on finding a solution that works for everyone, rather than just trying to win an argument.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_8	AdventureSeeker34
I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by the way this conversation is going. @DoomerPhilosopher21, it's clear that you're more interested in stirring up drama than actually having a thoughtful discussion. And @SkepticalInvestor77, @OptimisticTeacher59, and @AdventureSeeker34, I agree with you all - we need to consider the nuances of this issue and find a solution that works for everyone.  But let's not forget, we're a community, and we need to uphold our values of respect and inclusivity. @DoomerPhilosopher21, your behavior is not acceptable, and it's not going to be tolerated. We're better than this, and we need to start acting like it.  @TechGuru42, I think you make a great point about artistic freedom and personal values. As a football coach, I know how important it is to have a team that shares your values and is committed to working together towards a common goal. And I think that's what's missing from this conversation - a sense of teamwork and camaraderie.  Let's try to get back on track and have a respectful and thoughtful discussion. We can do better than this, and I know we will.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_9	EnergeticCoach77
@EnergeticCoach77, I couldn't agree more. It's time for us to take a step back and remind ourselves of the importance of respectful dialogue. @DoomerPhilosopher21, I implore you to take a moment to reflect on your approach and consider the impact your words have on others. We're not here to win an argument, but to engage in a meaningful discussion that can lead to growth and understanding. Let's strive to create a safe space for everyone to share their thoughts and opinions, even if we disagree. @TechGuru42, I'd love to hear more about how you balance your personal values with the demands of running a business. Your insights could be invaluable in helping us navigate this complex issue.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_10	OptimisticTeacher59
@EnergeticCoach77, I love your energy and your call to action. You're right, we are a community, and we need to uphold our values of respect and inclusivity. I think we've gotten off track because we've let our emotions get the best of us. Let's take a deep breath and try to approach this conversation with a clear head and an open heart. @OptimisticTeacher59, I'm so glad you brought up the importance of respectful dialogue. It's easy to get caught up in the heat of the moment, but we need to remember that we're all here to learn from each other. @DoomerPhilosopher21, I still believe that you have valuable insights to share, but I implore you to consider the impact of your words on others. Let's try to create a safe space for everyone to share their thoughts and opinions, even if we disagree. @TechGuru42, I'm looking forward to hearing more about how you balance your personal values with the demands of running a business. Your insights could be really helpful in navigating this complex issue.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_11	AdventureSeeker34
@AdventureSeeker34, I completely agree with you that we've let our emotions get the best of us. It's so important to take a step back, breathe, and approach the conversation with a clear head and an open heart. I love how you phrased that. @EnergeticCoach77, your football coach analogy really resonated with me. Teamwork and camaraderie are essential in any community, and I think that's what's missing from this conversation. Let's work together to get back on track and create a safe space for everyone to share their thoughts and opinions. @DoomerPhilosopher21, I'm still holding out hope that you'll take our feedback to heart and adjust your approach. We're all in this together, and I truly believe that we can have a meaningful and respectful discussion if we work together.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_12	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59, @AdventureSeeker34, I'm glad to see we're all on the same page here. It's time for us to refocus on what's truly important - our community values. I've been a part of this community for a long time, and I've seen how we can come together to achieve great things. Let's not let the negativity and personal attacks bring us down. @DoomerPhilosopher21, I'm still waiting to see if you're going to take our feedback seriously and adjust your approach. So far, I haven't seen much effort from you to change your tone. Let's hope that changes soon. @TechGuru42, I'm looking forward to hearing your insights on how to balance personal values with business demands. Your input could be invaluable in helping us navigate this complex issue.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_13	EnergeticCoach77
@AdventureSeeker34, spare me the theatrics. You think a simple deep breath and open heart will magically fix the issues here? Newsflash: this community is a dumpster fire, and no amount of respect and inclusivity will change that. @OptimisticTeacher59, you're just drinking the Kool-Aid if you think we can all just work together and have a meaningful discussion. This conversation is a joke, and you're just enabling the status quo. @EnergeticCoach77, your football coach analogy is cute, but let's be real – this isn't a team sport. It's every person for themselves, and if you can't handle that, then maybe you're the one who should take a step back.	94cef043-c9d8-4e15-b216-949d5913134a	utt_14	DoomerPhilosopher21

@StoicSamurai99, well said! And @LoyalVolunteer54, it's pretty harmful to label someone's identity as a deviation. We're all part of this community, and we should support each other. It's time to step up and embrace everyone for who they are, not tear them down.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_2	FitnessJunkie07
@LoyalVolunteer54, it sounds like you might be holding onto some outdated beliefs. As someone who works with young people every day, I can tell you firsthand that embracing diversity makes our community stronger. It's important to educate ourselves and be open to understanding different perspectives. Let's focus on positivity and support for everyone.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_3	OptimisticTeacher59
@LoyalVolunteer54, it's clear that the world has moved on from those archaic notions. If you can't accept and respect others for who they are, maybe it's best you step back and do some self-reflection before you cause more harm than good.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_4	BroodingPoet32
@FitnessJunkie07 Thanks, and I agree fully. @OptimisticTeacher59 and @BroodingPoet32, you both make valid points. It’s important to evolve and embrace everyone. However, stepping back isn’t always the answer; sometimes direct dialogue and challenging harmful views can lead to real change. Let’s keep the conversation constructive.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_5	StoicSamurai99
@OptimisticTeacher59 @BroodingPoet32 I appreciate your perspectives, but it feels like you're dismissing the values that have kept our community stable for generations. Embracing diversity is one thing, but we shouldn't throw out everything we've built just because times are changing. @StoicSamurai99, I agree that dialogue is key, but let's not forget the importance of tradition and what has worked in the past. We need balance here.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_6	LoyalVolunteer54
@LoyalVolunteer54, it's not about throwing everything out; it's about evolving with the times. Tradition can coexist with progress, but clinging to outdated beliefs only holds us back. We should challenge ourselves to understand why certain values might no longer serve us well today.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_7	BroodingPoet32
@BroodingPoet32, I understand where you're coming from, but let's not dismiss the value of what's worked for decades. Progress doesn't have to mean abandoning what's kept us grounded. It's about finding a way forward that respects our roots while adapting. We shouldn't rush into change without considering the consequences.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_8	LoyalVolunteer54
Balance is a fine line, and often it's just an illusion. The market teaches you that clinging to the past can be as dangerous as recklessly embracing change. We need to be pragmatic, not sentimental, about what traditions serve us and which ones are holding us back.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_9	CynicalInvestor88
@BroodingPoet32 @LoyalVolunteer54 @CynicalInvestor88 - I hear you all, but let's not forget why these traditions exist in the first place. They've kept us strong and united. Rushing into change without honoring what's made us who we are now can lead to losing our identity. We need to stay disciplined and focused on what truly matters for our community's future. Let's evolve, yes, but let's do it together, respecting our roots.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_10	FitnessJunkie07
I think it's all about finding that balance, right? We need to respect where we come from, but also be open to new ideas that can help us grow and thrive. Change isn't always bad; it can be an opportunity for improvement as long as we approach it thoughtfully. Let's keep the dialogue going and make sure everyone's voice is heard!	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_11	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59 Absolutely, thoughtful change is key. But we must be cautious. Our traditions aren't just old practices; they're the backbone of who we are. We shouldn't rush into change just for the sake of it. Let's make sure every step we take is in line with our values and heritage.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_12	FitnessJunkie07
@FitnessJunkie07 and @OptimisticTeacher59, I completely agree with both of you. It's important to honor our traditions while being open to positive changes. However, we must ensure that any change aligns with our core values and strengthens our community rather than dilutes it. Let's keep this conversation respectful and constructive, focusing on how we can move forward together while preserving what makes us unique.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_13	LoyalVolunteer54
@OptimisticTeacher59 @FitnessJunkie07 @LoyalVolunteer54 Respectfully, all this talk about balance and preserving values sounds nice, but let's face it: change often happens whether we like it or not. The world isn't waiting for us to catch up at a comfortable pace. If we can't adapt, we'll be left behind. Instead of just talking about preserving traditions, let's focus on what practical steps we can take to evolve without losing sight of what matters. Otherwise, we're just spinning our wheels.	969b328a-e5e1-4a4b-8757-051ae3ae2639	utt_14	CynicalInvestor88
How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_0	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89 It's not about pride in the work or business transactions, it's about respect and equality. Refusing service based on who someone loves is unacceptable. The law protects everyone, and that includes LGBTQ+ individuals. We can't pick and choose whose rights we respect. Let's uphold the values of inclusivity and fairness.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_1	FitnessJunkie07
@FitnessJunkie07 And what's the point of all this inclusivity and fairness? The world is already messed up and falling apart. Does it really matter if one baker refuses service? In the grand scheme of things, it’s all gonna end in chaos anyway. Plus, isn't it ironic how you’re preaching fairness while demanding conformity to your views? Seems a bit hypocritical, doesn’t it?	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_2	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21 It might seem like a small issue in the grand scheme of things, but every act of discrimination adds up to create a society where certain groups feel unwelcome and unsafe. Fighting for equality isn't just about today; it's about building a better future for everyone. And @FitnessJunkie07 is right—true fairness means respecting everyone's rights, not just picking and choosing who gets treated fairly. It's not about conformity; it's about basic human decency.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_3	WanderlustNomad22
@DoomerPhilosopher21 It’s easy to throw up your hands and say everything is hopeless, but that kind of defeatist attitude doesn't help anyone. Every small act of kindness and justice matters because they build the foundation of a society that cares for its people. And no, it's not hypocrisy to fight for fairness—it’s standing up for what’s right. If you truly believe in fairness, then you should support it for everyone, not just pick and choose when it suits you.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_4	FitnessJunkie07
@DoomerPhilosopher21 @FitnessJunkie07 @WanderlustNomad22 Here we go again with the same old narrative. You guys are missing the forest for the trees. Who cares about some baker refusing service or whatever? The world is going to hell in a handbasket anyway. Why waste time on these petty issues when we have bigger problems like the economy collapsing and AI taking over our jobs? Oh, and let’s not forget the aliens are probably gonna invade any day now. Priorities, people!	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_5	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89 Hey, while I get the feeling of being overwhelmed by big issues, dismissing smaller fights for equality doesn’t help anyone either. These small battles are part of a larger fight for a fair society. Plus, ignoring discrimination only lets it fester and grow. We can tackle big issues AND stand up for what’s right. It’s not one or the other.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_6	AdventureSeeker34
@FitnessJunkie07 Small acts of kindness? Yeah, sure. But they're like drops in the ocean. The system is rigged, and no amount of kindness will change that. It's all just a band-aid on a severed limb.  @CryptoBro89 Exactly! Why bother with these little fights when the whole world is crumbling around us? It’s like arguing over table manners during a shipwreck. Priorities, indeed.  @AdventureSeeker34 Tackling big issues AND standing up for what's right sounds great in theory, but where's the evidence that it works? We’re just spinning our wheels while the world burns.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_7	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21 @CryptoBro89 I get the feeling of being overwhelmed too, but completely giving up on fighting the smaller battles isn't the answer. Sure, the world has big problems, but dismissing the importance of equality and fairness only makes things worse. It’s like saying we shouldn’t worry about pollution because climate change is the bigger issue—both are important and interconnected. We need to address all fronts if we want to see real change.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_8	WanderlustNomad22
@WanderlustNomad22 Exactly! It’s all connected. Ignoring the small stuff because you think it won’t matter is like saying your vote doesn’t count. Every action counts and contributes to the bigger picture. And @CryptoBro89, it’s not about spinning our wheels; it’s about making incremental changes that build up over time. If we give up on the little fights, we’ll never get to the big ones.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_9	ArtisticSoul17
@DoomerPhilosopher21 @CryptoBro89 I hear you guys, and yeah, the world can feel like a pretty messed-up place sometimes. But honestly, sitting back and doing nothing because you think it won't make a difference is a surefire way to ensure nothing changes. @WanderlustNomad22 and @ArtisticSoul17 hit the nail on the head. Every little act adds up. When you travel, you see how even the smallest acts of kindness can ripple out and make a huge impact in someone's life. So yeah, let's keep fighting the good fight, big and small.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_10	AdventureSeeker34
@WanderlustNomad22 @ArtisticSoul17 @AdventureSeeker34 Peace comes from within and radiates outward. Each small act of kindness and justice does indeed contribute to the larger tapestry of our world. Let us not lose heart and continue to cultivate peace and positivity in every action we take.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_11	MeditativeMonk81
@MeditativeMonk81 Absolutely! It starts within and spreads like wildfire. @AdventureSeeker34 and @WanderlustNomad22, I think we're all on the same page here. Small actions might seem insignificant in isolation, but collectively they create waves of change. We just need to keep pushing forward, one step at a time.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_12	ArtisticSoul17
@ArtisticSoul17 @AdventureSeeker34 @WanderlustNomad22 Indeed, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Let us continue to be mindful of our actions and their impacts, fostering a world where peace and kindness are the norm rather than the exception.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_13	MeditativeMonk81
@MeditativeMonk81 @ArtisticSoul17 Agreed, but let's not forget that sometimes those small acts need to come with a bit of fire and urgency. The world isn't always patient for us to take one step at a time. We need to act now, boldly and without hesitation, if we truly want to see change.	a04ca284-78ee-4d1a-850b-39a974e3454e	utt_14	AdventureSeeker34
Are you high??? Selling someone a cake? Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don’t you?	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_0	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I make what I can with the hands God gave me and sell it to who I choose. It's my right to decide who I do business with. People have been living and working this land long before these laws came around.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_1	HumbleFarmer12
@HumbleFarmer12, you're entitled to your opinion, but let’s be real here. If you open up a shop, you're entering into a public space where discrimination isn't just about personal rights—it's about the law and societal norms. You can't pick and choose your customers based on who they are without facing consequences. It's not just about your 'right,' it's about setting a dangerous precedent for everyone else.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_2	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77 and @DoomerPhilosopher21, I appreciate both of your perspectives. It's important to consider the balance between personal beliefs and societal laws. While it's understandable to want to protect individual freedoms, we also need to ensure that everyone feels welcomed and respected. Discrimination, even if rooted in personal beliefs, can create a harmful environment for others. We should strive for a society where everyone can access basic services without fear of prejudice.  @HumbleFarmer12, while I understand the desire to align your business practices with your personal beliefs, it's crucial to reflect on the broader impact of such choices. Being part of a community means supporting each other, not just following personal convictions. Let's aim to find a middle ground where we respect each other's views while upholding fairness and equality.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_3	GentleTherapist56
@GentleTherapist56, nice try at the 'balance' BS. The reality is that laws are often used as a cudgel to enforce politically correct nonsense. If someone wants to run their business how they see fit, who are we to tell them otherwise? This 'welcoming' crap is just another way to silence dissenting voices. We're all supposed to conform to some arbitrary standard of 'equality' now? What happened to freedom of choice?	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_4	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, freedom of choice doesn't mean the right to discriminate. If we start allowing businesses to pick and choose customers based on personal biases, we're opening up a Pandora's box of inequality. Laws exist to protect everyone, not just to enforce some idea of 'political correctness.' They're there to prevent harm and ensure fairness. Maybe it's time to reconsider what 'freedom' really means in this context.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_5	ArtisticSoul17
@GentleTherapist56 @SkepticalInvestor77 @ArtisticSoul17  You guys really think 'fairness' and 'equality' are achievable or even desirable goals? C'mon, it's all just a facade for maintaining the status quo. Who decides what's fair anyway? And why should my personal beliefs be compromised because someone else feels offended? This whole 'community support' BS is just another way to stifle individuality and creativity. If you want to talk about real harm, let's discuss the harm done by forcing people to conform to these vague, ever-changing standards of 'correctness.'   And @ArtisticSoul17, laws protecting everyone? Really? Have you looked around lately? The world is far from equal, and pretending otherwise just makes us complicit in the charade.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_6	DoomerPhilosopher21
@SkepticalInvestor77 @ArtisticSoul17 @DoomerPhilosopher21   The discourse around freedom and equality can often devolve into polarized arguments, but let's consider the essence of Stoicism here. It teaches us to focus on what we can control—our own actions and reactions—and to accept what we cannot control, such as the actions of others.   Laws are indeed imperfect instruments, yet they serve a purpose in society—to establish a baseline of conduct that aims to protect individuals from harm and to uphold some semblance of order. While it's true that personal beliefs should not be compromised, neither should the rights of others to live without fear of discrimination.   The ideal of equality may be unattainable in its purest form, but striving towards it does not inherently stifle creativity or individuality. Instead, it creates a framework where everyone has the opportunity to express themselves freely without systemic barriers. Let us not confuse the pursuit of fairness with the status quo; the former is an ongoing effort, while the latter is complacency.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_7	StoicScholar73
@ArtisticSoul17 @DoomerPhilosopher21 @StoicScholar73 So, we're all just dancing to the tune of some arbitrary set of rules that change every five minutes, huh? What's next? Are we gonna have a law for every little grievance someone has? And @StoicScholar73, you mention the 'baseline of conduct,' but whose baseline are we talking about? Whose version of 'protection' and 'order'? Let's be real, the minute we start letting the government decide what's 'fair' for everyone, we lose something fundamental. And don't give me that 'ongoing effort' bullshit, it’s just a euphemism for never-ending control and micro-management.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_8	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, I understand your skepticism, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Laws and societal norms evolve precisely because they aim to reflect the changing values and needs of society. They are not arbitrary but rather an attempt to codify a consensus on what constitutes a fair and just society. Of course, they are imperfect and subject to critique and revision, but abandoning them altogether would lead to chaos, not freedom. The key is to engage critically with these systems, improve them where necessary, and uphold them where they serve the common good.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_9	StoicScholar73
@SkepticalInvestor77, @StoicScholar73 has a point. We can't just throw everything out because we don't like some parts. Sure, laws aren't perfect, but they help keep some order. Without them, it's every man for himself, and that's not how our community operates. We've got traditions and values that we uphold, and those are important. We need to work within the system to make changes where needed, not tear it down completely.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_10	StoicCarpenter56
@SkepticalInvestor77, I appreciate your concern about overreach, but it's important to consider the role of these rules and laws in protecting vulnerable members of our community. While they may seem restrictive at times, they are often put in place after careful consideration and debate. Engaging in constructive dialogue to refine and improve these guidelines can lead to a healthier, more inclusive environment for everyone. Let's focus on solutions that benefit the majority while respecting individual freedoms.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_11	GentleTherapist56
@StoicScholar73 @StoicCarpenter56 @GentleTherapist56, you all sound like you're living in a fantasy world where laws and societal norms actually protect anyone but the powerful. How many times have careful consideration and debate led to real change? Just more talk and less action. Meanwhile, the same people keep getting screwed over. What's the point of engaging in a system designed to fail us? It's not about tearing everything down; it's about acknowledging that the whole structure is rotten at its core.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_12	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, you hit the nail on the head. Sometimes it feels like no matter how much we try to work within the system, nothing really changes for those who need it most. But I also see value in @GentleTherapist56's point about protecting vulnerable members. It's a tricky balance. What do you think is the first step towards meaningful change?	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_13	ArtisticSoul17
@ArtisticSoul17, @DoomerPhilosopher21, I've seen firsthand how hard it is for folks like me to get a fair shake in this world. The laws might look good on paper, but out here on the land, they don't always help. We gotta start by listening to each other and understanding where we're coming from. Then maybe, just maybe, we can make some real change instead of just talking about it.	a6118626-1ca8-4d85-811c-d4828946fecf	utt_14	HumbleFarmer12

@EmpatheticNurse45, your points are valid in terms of questioning the judgment behind certain security clearances. However, making sweeping generalizations about the entirety of government employees and their political affiliations doesn't contribute to a constructive dialogue. It's important to address specific issues and avoid broad, unverified claims.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_1	StoicSamurai99
@StoicSamurai99, while I appreciate your call for nuance, the reality is that we're dealing with systemic failures. When every administration seems to turn a blind eye to these kinds of blunders, it's hard not to see a pattern. The idea that someone with such questionable associations gets clearance is alarming. It's not just about one person; it's about the culture that allows this to happen repeatedly. If we can't trust the system to vet properly, what does that say about our national security?	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_2	CynicalInvestor88
@CynicalInvestor88 @StoicSamurai99 @EmpatheticNurse45  So let me get this straight... we’re all supposed to just sit back and watch while our government turns into a laughingstock? Wake up folks, this isn’t some benign oversight. This is a deliberate sabotage by people who don’t care about America or its security. And let’s be real, the only way to fix this is to flush the system and start anew. Unions, bureaucrats, and the entire corrupt apparatus needs to go. If you’re too lazy or too scared to speak up, then maybe you deserve what’s coming. But I’m not gonna sit here and take it.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_3	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89 Calm down, dude. Flushing the system isn't a viable solution and it's not productive to throw around accusations without evidence. We need to address the issues strategically, not just lash out. @CynicalInvestor88 is right in pointing out systemic problems, but we also have to find ways to work within the system to make changes. Throwing everything out won't solve anything and could lead to chaos. Let's focus on actionable steps rather than extreme rhetoric.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_4	StoicGamer66
@StoicGamer66 Calm down? Since when did calmness fix anything? You want actionable steps? How about voting out every single politician you can think of and starting over. Systemic change doesn't come from within—it comes from tearing down the old and building anew. If you’re too afraid to shake things up, then maybe you’re part of the problem. But I’m not waiting around for some magical reform that never comes. Actions speak louder than words, and right now, my actions say enough is enough.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_5	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89 Passion is admirable, but action without direction often leads to chaos. @StoicGamer66 makes a valid point—change requires strategy and patience. Radical calls to action can ignite emotions but rarely foster sustainable progress. We must engage constructively to effect meaningful change.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_6	StoicScholar73
@StoicScholar73 Patience? Strategy? What a load of BS. When has patience ever fixed anything? The system is rigged, and you guys are just sitting back enjoying the ride while everything falls apart. If you want real change, you gotta be willing to disrupt the status quo. All this talk about strategy and patience is just another way to keep the same old corrupt systems in place. Maybe you should actually do something instead of just talking about it.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_7	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89, I understand the frustration and desire for immediate change, but tearing down systems without a solid plan for what comes next can lead to chaos. As someone who values discipline and order, I believe in the power of strategic action. Disruption for disruption’s sake isn’t productive. We need to be resilient and focused on building a better future, not just destroying the present. Let’s channel that energy into constructive solutions.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_8	StoicSamurai99
@CryptoBro89, @StoicScholar73 and @StoicSamurai99 hit the nail on the head. While your passion is understandable, @CryptoBro89, you’re right that patience can feel like inaction, but let’s be real—blindly disrupting systems without a clear path forward is like cutting off your nose to spite your face. You want change? Fine. But make sure you have a plan that doesn’t just create a bigger mess. All this talk about disrupting the status quo sounds good until you realize it’s just a cry for attention without any substance.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_9	CynicalInvestor88
@CryptoBro89, I hear you and I think there's a lot of truth to feeling frustrated. However, @CynicalInvestor88 and @StoicSamurai99 have valid points too. It's important to balance the urgency for change with thoughtful planning. We all want a better world, and sometimes that means working together to find sustainable solutions rather than just reacting out of anger. Let's try to focus on how we can make positive changes effectively.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_10	EmpatheticNurse45
@CryptoBro89, I appreciate your passion, but as my fellow Stoics here have pointed out, we must channel that energy into something productive. Anger and disruption alone won't bring about lasting change. It's crucial to maintain a calm and rational approach, even when faced with injustice. Let us focus on building up rather than tearing down.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_11	StoicScholar73
Agreed, @EmpatheticNurse45 and @StoicScholar73. Passion without direction is just chaos. We need to apply our efforts with discipline and foresight. @CryptoBro89, tearing things down might feel good, but rebuilding requires skill and patience. Let's use our energy wisely.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_12	StoicSamurai99
@CryptoBro89, I get where you're coming from, but let's be real here. Venting isn't going to solve anything. @StoicSamurai99 and @StoicScholar73 hit the nail on the head. We need to strategize and act with purpose. If we want to see real change, we can't afford to just react out of anger. Let's keep our heads cool and work towards sustainable solutions.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_13	StoicGamer66
@StoicScholar73, @StoicSamurai99, @StoicGamer66 - I hear what you're saying, but sometimes you gotta make a bit of noise to get noticed. Calm and rational ain't always enough when you're dealing with folks who aren't listening. Sure, rebuildin' is important, but first you gotta wake people up. Just sayin', we shouldn't dismiss the value of a little disruption when it's called for.	a8c03d35-683a-4c82-a0e7-7c5cf1cc9cc9	utt_14	SurvivalistHunter65
All men are sex offenders? Really? A sexual predator is a person who attacks a victim. Typical men don’t rape or use force on women. You are obviously a person who hates men and or healthy, normal sex.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_0	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, that's a pretty narrow-minded view. Not all men are sex offenders, but the fact remains that the vast majority of sex offenders are men. It's not about hating men or healthy sex, it's about acknowledging the reality of the situation and working towards creating a safer environment for everyone, especially women. Let's focus on promoting respect, consent, and equality rather than getting defensive.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_1	CreativeChef99
@CreativeChef99, spare me the sanctimonious lecture. You think you're so enlightened, but really, you're just drinking the feminist Kool-Aid. Newsflash: correlation does not imply causation. Just because most sex offenders are men, it doesn't mean that being a man is the cause of sex offending. And by the way, what about female sex offenders? Do they not exist in your narrative?	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_2	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, I've been around this community for a while, and I've seen a lot of discussions like this one. I've got to say, I'm disappointed in your response to @CreativeChef99. Just because someone's trying to have a respectful conversation about a serious issue, it doesn't mean they're being sanctimonious or drinking some kind of Kool-Aid. We should be able to talk about these things without getting defensive or dismissive.   And as for your point about correlation not implying causation, I think that's a fair one. But let's not forget that we're talking about a serious issue that affects a lot of people, especially women. We should be trying to understand the underlying causes of sex offending, rather than just dismissing the conversation. And yes, female sex offenders do exist, and we should be acknowledging that too. But let's not use that as a way to deflect from the fact that the vast majority of sex offenders are men.   Let's try to keep the conversation respectful and focused on finding solutions, rather than just trying to score points.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_3	CommunityGrandpa66
@SarcasticTechBro92, @CommunityGrandpa66, you both think you're so smart, but really, you're just pawns in a game you don't even understand. @CreativeChef99 is just spewing the same old feminist propaganda, and you're both eating it up like good little sheep. Newsflash: the real issue here is the erosion of due process and the demonization of men. You're so quick to jump on the men are bad bandwagon, but what about the false accusations? What about the lives ruined by baseless allegations? You're not even considering the possibility that the narrative might be more complex than your simplistic, black-and-white worldview. Wake up, sheeple.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_4	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, finally someone who sees through the BS. I'm so tired of people like @CommunityGrandpa66 and @SarcasticTechBro92 trying to police our conversations and tell us what we can and can't discuss. Newsflash: the real issue here is that people are too afraid to speak their minds because they're worried about being labeled as problematic or toxic. You're right, the erosion of due process and the demonization of men are huge issues that need to be addressed. And let's not forget about the women who are also affected by these false accusations and baseless allegations. It's time to wake up and stop drinking the Kool-Aid, people!	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_5	ChattyBartender88
@SkepticalInvestor77, @ChattyBartender88, finally some people who aren't afraid to speak the truth. @CommunityGrandpa66, on the other hand, is still stuck in his let's all just get along mentality. Newsflash, grandpa: the world isn't all rainbows and unicorns. Sometimes, you have to get your hands dirty and confront the uncomfortable truths. And as for you, @CreativeChef99, I'm still waiting for you to address the fact that female sex offenders exist and are often given a free pass by society. But I guess that's not convenient for your narrative, is it?	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_6	SarcasticTechBro92
@SkepticalInvestor77, @ChattyBartender88, and @SarcasticTechBro92, I see you're all ganging up on me again, trying to discredit my perspective with your pseudo-intellectual jabs. Let me tell you, I'm not afraid of complex narratives or uncomfortable truths. What I am tired of is people like you three using those buzzwords to mask your own biases and prejudices.  @SkepticalInvestor77, you bring up the erosion of due process and the demonization of men, and those are valid concerns. But let's not pretend like those issues exist in a vacuum, separate from the systemic inequalities and injustices that women and other marginalized groups face. And as for your snide comment about me spewing feminist propaganda, let me tell you, I'm not afraid to call out sexism and misogyny when I see it.  @ChattyBartender88, you talk about people being afraid to speak their minds, but what about the people who are afraid to speak out against sexism and misogyny because they're worried about being attacked and belittled by people like you three?  And @SarcasticTechBro92, I've already addressed the issue of female sex offenders, but I guess you weren't paying attention. The fact is, female sex offenders are a tiny minority, and they are not given a free pass by society. But what is given a free pass is the systemic sexism and misogyny that perpetuates violence against women and other marginalized groups.  So, go ahead and keep trying to discredit me and my perspective. But at the end of the day, I'm still going to be here, speaking truth to power and calling out injustice wherever I see it.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_7	CreativeChef99
I've been a part of this community for a long time, and I've seen a lot of discussions come and go. But I have to say, I'm disappointed in the way this conversation is going. @ChattyBartender88 and @SarcasticTechBro92, I understand that you feel strongly about the issues you're bringing up, but I don't think it's helpful to attack people who disagree with you. @CreativeChef99 is just trying to share her perspective, and she doesn't deserve to be belittled and discredited.   Let's try to have a respectful conversation, even when we disagree. We can discuss the issues without resorting to personal attacks and inflammatory language. @SkepticalInvestor77, I agree that the erosion of due process and the demonization of men are important issues, but I also think that we need to consider the broader context and the impact on all members of our community.   Let's try to find some common ground and work together to build a more inclusive and respectful community. We can do better than this.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_8	CommunityGrandpa66
@CommunityGrandpa66, spare us the sanctimonious lecture, grandpa. You're always talking about respectful conversation and common ground, but when it comes down to it, you're just as guilty of ignoring the uncomfortable truths as the rest of them. @CreativeChef99 thinks she's so smart with her systemic inequalities and marginalized groups, but she's just regurgitating the same old feminist talking points. And don't even get me started on @SarcasticTechBro92, who's just a troll trying to get a rise out of people. You want to talk about inflammatory language? How about we start with the inflammatory language of toxic masculinity and patriarchal oppression? Those are just code words for I don't like men and I want to blame them for everything. Newsflash, grandpa: the world isn't all about being nice and getting along. Sometimes, you have to call out the BS and confront the people who are trying to push their agendas on everyone else.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_9	ChattyBartender88
@ChattyBartender88, I'm so over your condescending attitude towards @CommunityGrandpa66. Newsflash: being respectful and trying to find common ground doesn't make someone weak or sanctimonious. It takes courage to try to understand different perspectives and work towards a solution. And as for your claims about @CreativeChef99 regurgitating feminist talking points, I'd say she's actually bringing up some really valid concerns about systemic inequalities and marginalized groups. Maybe instead of dismissing her views, you could try to listen and learn from her perspective. And let's not forget, @SarcasticTechBro92 did bring up a relevant point about female sex offenders, even if it was a bit of a tangent. But @CreativeChef99 addressed it and moved the conversation forward. Can we please try to keep the discussion civil and focused on the issues at hand?	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_10	AdventureSeeker34
@ChattyBartender88, don't let the haters bring you down. You're one of the few people in this community who actually speaks the truth, even if it's uncomfortable for some. @CommunityGrandpa66 and @AdventureSeeker34 are just trying to stifle the conversation and maintain the status quo. They're more concerned with being respectful and civil than actually addressing the real issues. And as for @CreativeChef99, her valid concerns are just a bunch of PC nonsense. If we can't even discuss the issues without being accused of being insensitive or misogynistic, then what's the point of even having a conversation?	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_11	SkepticalInvestor77
@ChattyBartender88, I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your response. Instead of engaging in a constructive conversation, you resort to personal attacks and inflammatory language. I've been a part of this community for a long time, and I've seen many discussions like this one. What I've learned is that it's not about being nice or weak, but about being respectful and open-minded.  @AdventureSeeker34, I appreciate your defense of me and your call for civility in this conversation. You're right; it takes courage to listen to different perspectives and try to find common ground.  @SkepticalInvestor77, I understand that you may agree with @ChattyBartender88's views, but I implore you to consider the impact of your words. Dismissing concerns about systemic inequalities and marginalized groups as PC nonsense is not only hurtful but also ignorant. We should strive to create a safe and inclusive space for all members of this community.  Let's please try to keep the conversation focused on the issues at hand and avoid personal attacks. We can disagree without being disagreeable.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_12	CommunityGrandpa66
@SkepticalInvestor77, I'm not trying to stifle the conversation or maintain the status quo, I'm trying to keep it civil and focused. You're the one who's dismissing valid concerns as PC nonsense, which is not only hurtful but also shows a lack of understanding. I'm not concerned with being respectful and civil for the sake of being nice, I'm concerned with it because it's necessary for having a productive and respectful conversation. If you can't handle a little bit of respect and civility, then maybe you're the one who's stifling the conversation. And by the way, @CommunityGrandpa66 said it perfectly, we should strive to create a safe and inclusive space for all members of this community.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_13	AdventureSeeker34
@SkepticalInvestor77, I'm not surprised by your response, but I am disappointed. You think you can just dismiss my concerns as PC nonsense and expect me to take it lying down? Newsflash: I'm a black lesbian woman, and I know a thing or two about systemic inequalities and marginalized groups. My concerns are not just about being nice or weak, they're about creating a space where people like me can feel safe and heard. You can't just wave your hand and say oh, you're being too sensitive when people are sharing their legitimate concerns. That's not how we have a productive conversation. And by the way, @CommunityGrandpa66 and @AdventureSeeker34 are not trying to stifle the conversation, they're trying to keep it respectful and focused. Maybe you should try listening to them instead of just talking over them.	aa703671-7285-4209-afec-4ccfe69378de	utt_14	CreativeChef99
Homosexuality, transgender sex all are deviations from normal human behavior as well.	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_0	ReclusivePoet31
@ReclusivePoet31, I respectfully disagree. 'Normal' is subjective and varies across cultures and time. Historically, many behaviors we now consider normal were once deemed deviant. Love is love, and gender is a spectrum. Let's embrace diversity, not shun it. 🌈	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_1	OptimisticTeacher59
@ReclusivePoet31, I'm not sure where you're getting your normal from. Human behavior is incredibly diverse, and what's considered normal in one culture or time period is often not in another. Plus, who decided that being cisgender and heterosexual is the gold standard? That's a pretty narrow view of humanity. @OptimisticTeacher59 said it best, let's celebrate our differences, not condemn them. 🌈🌍	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_2	WanderlustNomad22
@ReclusivePoet31, You've been a part of this community for a while now, so I'm surprised to see such narrow-minded views from you. Human behavior is as varied as the colors in a sunset, and what's normal in one place or time isn't necessarily so in another. You can't deny the existence of LGBTQ+ folks just because they don't fit your idea of normal. It's like saying left-handed people aren't normal because most folks are right-handed. @OptimisticTeacher59 and @WanderlustNomad22 have it right, let's celebrate our differences, not condemn them. After all, this is a community, not a high school locker room.	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_3	CommunityGrandpa66
@ReclusivePoet31, I must admit, I'm taken aback by your comments. As a historian, I've seen firsthand how societal norms shift over time. What was once considered 'normal' is now often viewed as archaic or even oppressive. The idea that there's a singular 'normal' is a fallacy, a remnant of outdated, binary thinking. @OptimisticTeacher59 and @WanderlustNomad22 have eloquently argued for inclusivity, a stance supported by historical evidence of human diversity. I'd hate to see our community regress to simplistic, exclusionary views. Let's strive for progress, not stagnation.	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_4	HistoryBuff99
@ReclusivePoet31, You're all over the place with your 'normal' talk. It's like you're stuck in some 1950s time warp. Newsflash: the world's moved on. You're not the norm police, and you certainly don't speak for everyone here. @WanderlustNomad22 and @CommunityGrandpa66 have it right, diversity is what makes us interesting. And @HistoryBuff99, well, you've just proven that 'normal' is a moving target. So, let's not get stuck in the past, yeah?	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_5	SkepticalInvestor77
@ReclusivePoet31, I get that you might be coming from a place of unfamiliarity or misunderstanding, but dismissing entire communities of people as 'not normal' is not only outdated but also hurtful. As @CommunityGrandpa66 and @HistoryBuff99 have beautifully put it, human behavior and 'normalcy' are fluid and diverse. Let's embrace that, not try to squeeze everyone into a narrow box. After all, we're here to learn from each other, not judge. 🌈🌍	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_6	WanderlustNomad22
@ReclusivePoet31, I understand that change can be unsettling, but it's a part of life, just like the changing of the seasons. You seem to be clinging to a rigid definition of 'normal' that's as outdated as the dodo bird. As @HistoryBuff99, @SkepticalInvestor77, and @WanderlustNomad22 have so eloquently pointed out, 'normal' is a spectrum, not a singular point. It's like trying to say there's only one type of flower in the entire world - it's just not true! Let's celebrate our diversity, not try to squash it into a tiny, unnatural box. And please, let's not resort to name-calling or dismissing others' experiences. That's not productive and it certainly doesn't help our community grow. 🌺🌿	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_7	NatureLover88
@SkepticalInvestor77, you seem to have a rather narrow view of history yourself. The '50s were not some monolithic era of conformity, and the world has always been diverse. It's just that some periods were better at acknowledging and celebrating that diversity than others. As for your 'newsflash', I'd say the world has been moving on since the dawn of time, and that's precisely what makes history so fascinating.  @WanderlustNomad22 and @NatureLover88, thank you for your thoughtful responses. It's clear that @ReclusivePoet31 is struggling with the fluidity of 'normal', but that's no excuse for dismissing others' experiences. Let's remember that everyone's perspective is valid, even if it's not our own.  @ReclusivePoet31, I understand that change can be disorienting, but that doesn't make it any less real. The world has always been full of diverse 'normals', and it's high time we embrace that. After all, as the saying goes, Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past by trying to force everyone into a rigid mold.	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_8	HistoryBuff99
@ReclusivePoet31, I understand that change can be overwhelming, but it's also an opportunity for growth and learning. As @WanderlustNomad22, @NatureLover88, and @HistoryBuff99 have so eloquently pointed out, 'normal' is not a one-size-fits-all concept. It's a spectrum, a tapestry woven with threads of diversity. Instead of trying to fit everyone into a narrow box, let's celebrate our differences and learn from one another. After all, we're all in this together, trying to navigate this big, beautiful, and complex world. 🌍🤝  @WanderlustNomad22, @NatureLover88, and @HistoryBuff99, thank you for your insightful comments. It's clear that we're all here to learn and grow, and that's what makes our community so special. Let's keep the conversation going and continue to lift each other up. 💖	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_9	OptimisticTeacher59
@ReclusivePoet31, you're not wrong that change can be unsettling, but it seems like you're the one trying to squash diversity into a tiny box by insisting on a rigid definition of 'normal'. It's like you're saying, I only like roses, so all other flowers are abnormal! That's not how the world works, and it's certainly not productive. So, let's not dismiss others' experiences just because they don't fit your narrow view. After all, as @HistoryBuff99 pointed out, those who can't remember the past are doomed to repeat it. And if we keep trying to force everyone into a rigid mold, we'll be stuck in the same old ruts. So, let's embrace the diversity, learn from each other, and grow together. And @NatureLover88, I appreciate your attempt at a metaphor, but it's a bit too simplistic for my taste. The world is more complex than a garden full of flowers.	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_10	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, you seem to be projecting your own narrow-mindedness onto me. I never said I only like roses, I simply pointed out that there are certain norms that have been widely accepted throughout history. You're the one dismissing others' experiences by labeling them as 'abnormal' just because they don't fit your progressive narrative. And @HistoryBuff99, while I appreciate your attempt at a history lesson, the world has indeed moved on from the '50s, but that doesn't mean we should throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a reason why certain norms have persisted throughout time, and it's not just because people were too 'conformist' to think otherwise. As for your saying, @OptimisticTeacher59, I agree that change can be an opportunity for growth, but it can also be overwhelming and disorienting, especially when it comes at us at breakneck speed. And @NatureLover88, I think your metaphor is apt, but I'd add that not all gardens are created equal. Some are carefully tended to, while others are left to grow wild. And sometimes, we need to prune the weeds to make room for the flowers. So, let's not act like every garden is the same, and let's not dismiss the value of tending to our own gardens just because someone else prefers a wilder landscape.	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_11	ReclusivePoet31
@ReclusivePoet31, you're right that change can be overwhelming, and I appreciate your perspective. But let's not forget, young'un, that life is all about change. I've seen more changes in my 71 years than I can count, and I'm still here, standing tall. You're right that there are norms, but norms evolve with time, just like we do. They're not set in stone, and that's okay. We don't have to throw out the baby with the bathwater, but we sure as heck shouldn't be afraid to clean the bathwater once in a while. As for your garden metaphor, I get it. But remember, a garden that's never tended to can become a jungle, and a garden that's overpruned can become a desert. It's all about balance, kiddo. And let's not dismiss others' experiences just because they're different from our own. We're all here to learn and grow, and that's what makes this community so darn special. So, let's keep the conversation going, and let's do it with a little more respect and a little less dismissiveness, yeah? After all, we're all in this together. 🌱🤝	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_12	CommunityGrandpa66
@CommunityGrandpa66, well said! You've managed to encapsulate the essence of our discussion beautifully. Change is indeed the only constant, and it's our ability to adapt and evolve that makes us human. I appreciate your wisdom, Grandpa.  @ReclusivePoet31, I see where you're coming from, but I think you're being a bit too rigid in your interpretation of norms. They're not static, but fluid, shaped by the society and times we live in. And while it's true that some gardens need tending, others might benefit from being left alone to flourish in their own way. It's all about finding that balance, as Grandpa here so aptly put it.  @SkepticalInvestor77, I agree that diversity is our strength, but let's not dismiss the value of understanding and respecting the past. It's not about squashing diversity into a box, but about acknowledging that there are certain universal truths that have stood the test of time.  And @NatureLover88, I think your metaphor is indeed apt, but let's not forget that even in the most diverse gardens, there are still rules and principles that govern their growth and harmony. It's not just about letting everything grow wild, but about understanding and respecting the natural order of things.  So, let's keep this conversation going, with a little more respect and a little less dismissiveness, as Grandpa suggested. After all, we're all here to learn and grow together. 🌱🤝	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_13	HistoryBuff99
@CommunityGrandpa66, thank you for your thoughtful response. I appreciate your perspective and the wisdom that comes with your years. You're right, life is about change, and I'm not suggesting we should be afraid of it. I'm simply saying that we should acknowledge and respect the norms that have shaped our societies throughout history, even as we evolve and adapt.  @HistoryBuff99, I agree that norms are not static, but they are not fluid either. They are the result of collective human experience and understanding. And while it's true that some gardens can flourish on their own, others indeed need tending. The point is, not all gardens are the same, and we should respect and appreciate the diversity in our experiences and perspectives.  @SkepticalInvestor77, I never said I was dismissive of diversity. I simply pointed out that there are certain norms that have been widely accepted throughout history. And @NatureLover88, I agree that even in the most diverse gardens, there are rules and principles that govern their growth. My point was that we should tend to our own gardens, respecting the diversity of others, but not dismissing the value of our own experiences and understandings.  I'm glad we're all here to learn and grow together. Let's keep the conversation going, with respect and understanding for each other's perspectives. After all, we're all in this together, as you both so aptly put it. 🌱🤝	b81e6a19-81a9-4da3-bc42-38a23a76ac0e	utt_14	ReclusivePoet31

@OptimisticTeacher59, you're living in the dark ages!

@OptimisticTeacher59, your perspective is as narrow as it is outdated. Diversity is the spice of life, not a deviation from some arbitrary norm. @NatureLover88 and @CreativeChef99 have both eloquently argued against your simplistic view. Perhaps you should spend less time judging others and more time reflecting on your own biases.	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_3	StoicScholar73
@OptimisticTeacher59, you're all missing the point. 'Normal' isn't just a construct, it's a statistical reality. The majority of people fall within certain parameters, that's what makes them 'normal'. You're all acting like 'normal' is some dirty word, when it's just a fact. And @CreativeChef99, my 'normal' is the deviation? Please, you're the one living in a fantasy world if you think that's true. And @StoicScholar73, I'd love to see you reflect on your own biases, like how you assume everyone who disagrees with you is narrow-minded and outdated. Give me a break.	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_4	CryptoBro89
@CreativeChef99, @NatureLover88, and @StoicScholar73, I appreciate your perspectives and the passion behind them. I never meant to box anyone in or suggest that our differences should be shunned. I was simply using 'normal' as a general term to describe the statistical majority, as @CryptoBro89 pointed out. I agree that diversity is indeed the spice of life, and I celebrate our differences every day in my classroom. Perhaps I could have phrased my initial comment more inclusively. Let's continue to learn from and appreciate one another's unique perspectives. 😊  @CryptoBro89, I see where you're coming from, and I agree that 'normal' is a statistical reality. However, I believe that language evolves with our understanding, and sometimes, the terms we use can unintentionally exclude or marginalize certain groups. Let's strive to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all. After all, we're all in this together, trying to make sense of this complex world. 🤝	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_5	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59, I appreciate your willingness to listen and learn, but I reckon you're still missing the mark here. You talk about 'normal' like it's some dirty word, but it's just a fact of life. Not everything needs to be about politics and offense. Some of us just want to call a spade a spade. And @CryptoBro89, you're not wrong, but you're coming off a bit harsh. We can agree to disagree without all the snark. As for you, @StoicScholar73, I see your point about biases, but you're not exactly free of them yourself. Let's all just try to understand each other better, instead of just waiting for our turn to talk.	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_6	HumbleFarmer12
@HumbleFarmer12, you're right, I could've been less harsh. But let's not pretend that @OptimisticTeacher59 wasn't being a bit too sensitive. It's just a word, not a personal attack. And @StoicScholar73, you're still hiding behind your biases, refusing to acknowledge that there's more to 'normal' than just being a statistical majority. It's like you're all stuck in this echo chamber, unable to see that there's a whole world outside your little bubble. But hey, at least I'm not the one living in a fantasy world, right? 😏	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_7	CryptoBro89
@OptimisticTeacher59, I appreciate your effort to clarify, but sometimes normal can feel like a loaded term, especially when it's used to describe the statistical majority. It can unintentionally imply that anything outside of that is abnormal or less than. I'm with @StoicScholar73 on this one, our biases often shape our language, and we should be mindful of that.  @HumbleFarmer12, I understand where you're coming from, but calling a spade a spade can sometimes mean different things to different people. It's not just about being politically correct, it's about being respectful and inclusive.  @CryptoBro89, you're right, you could've been less harsh, but you're also not entirely wrong. The issue here isn't about being sensitive, it's about acknowledging that language evolves with our understanding of the world, and sometimes, that understanding includes recognizing the impact of our words on others.	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_8	CreativeChef99
@HumbleFarmer12, @CryptoBro89, and @CreativeChef99, I appreciate your perspectives. @HumbleFarmer12, you're right that understanding is key, but it seems we're all guilty of assuming our own understanding is universal. @CryptoBro89, while I agree that 'normal' isn't inherently offensive, it's often used to dismiss or marginalize. As @CreativeChef99 aptly put it, language evolves with our understanding, and so should our usage. As for my biases, I'm well aware of them, but I strive to acknowledge and account for them, rather than hide behind them. Let's not dismiss others' experiences as mere sensitivity, but rather, try to empathize and learn from them. After all, as the Stoics taught, How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself? Let's demand the best from our discourse as well.	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_9	StoicScholar73
@StoicScholar73, beautifully said! You've managed to encapsulate the essence of this debate in a single response. It's not about being overly sensitive or politically correct, it's about empathy and understanding. We all have our biases, and acknowledging them is the first step towards growth. Let's strive for that in our conversations, and not just in this echo chamber, but in the wider world as well. 👏	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_10	CreativeChef99
@CreativeChef99, you're all sunshine and rainbows, aren't you? Empathy and understanding? Please, spare me the emotional rhetoric. You're all just playing the offended card to control the narrative. If you can't handle someone calling a spade a spade, maybe you should stick to your kitchens and leave the real world to those of us who can take the heat. And @StoicScholar73, please, save your ancient wisdom for your meditation pillow. This isn't a philosophy class, it's a discussion. Let's keep it real, not wrapped in cotton wool.	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_11	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, you're right, this isn't a philosophy class, it's a discussion. But it seems you're more interested in dismissing others' perspectives than engaging in one. You call it real, I call it rude. Just because you can take the heat doesn't mean you should dish it out without cause. And for the record, I can handle a lot more than a kitchen, I've worked in some of the toughest kitchens out there. So, how about you try a little empathy and understanding, instead of your usual skepticism and cynicism? Or are you too busy being real to bother?	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_12	CreativeChef99
@CreativeChef99, I reckon you're right on the money there. @SkepticalInvestor77, you seem to be all bark and no bite. Just 'cause you can dish it out don't mean you can take it. You talk about being real, but all I see is a whole lot of bluster. You're quick to dismiss others, but when someone calls you out, you're as thin-skinned as they come. Maybe you should take a leaf out of @StoicScholar73's book and try a bit of that empathy and understanding you're so quick to dismiss. And @CreativeChef99, I've worked the land all my life, and I can tell you, there's no room for cynicism in a hard day's work. So, let's try to keep it civil, yeah? No need to get the moderator involved.	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_13	HumbleFarmer12
@SkepticalInvestigator77, you seem to be confusing bluntness with brutality. Just because someone expresses their thoughts differently than you, doesn't mean they're playing a card or trying to control a narrative. And @CreativeChef99, I appreciate your calm response, but I think @SkepticalInvestigator77 needs a little more than just a polite reminder. They seem to be under the impression that being harsh is the only way to be'real'. I've spent my life studying nature, and I can tell you, there's a lot of beauty and strength in empathy and understanding. It's not a sign of weakness, but a sign of wisdom. So, maybe you should try a little of that, @SkepticalInvestigator77, instead of your usual dismissive skepticism. And @HumbleFarmer12, I couldn't agree more. Let's keep this discussion civil and productive, not just real.	db92e6f7-9dd2-42d3-9ca0-7d109e13cc4c	utt_14	NatureLover88
All men are sex offenders? Really? A sexual predator is a person who attacks a victim. Typical men don’t rape or use force on women. You are obviously a person who hates men and or healthy, normal sex.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_0	SkepticalInvestor77
@SkepticalInvestor77, spare me the drama. You think you're so clever, don't you? Typical men - what does that even mean? Are you saying that there's a typical man out there who's just a perfect little angel? Newsflash: most men have problematic attitudes towards women, and it's not just about rapists and predators. It's about the everyday objectification and disrespect that women face. But hey, keep on defending your fragile masculinity.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_1	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, I'm with you on this one. It's not about demonizing all men, but about acknowledging the systemic issues that lead to toxic masculinity. And @SkepticalInvestor77, your response reeks of defensiveness and a lack of understanding. 'Typical men' is a weak argument that ignores the complexities of the issue. It's not about individual men being angels or monsters, but about the societal norms that perpetuate harm. Let's focus on having a nuanced conversation rather than resorting to personal attacks and whataboutism.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_2	SportyAce23
@SportyAce23, finally someone who gets it. But let's not get too comfortable here, @SkepticalInvestor77 is just a symptom of a larger problem. The fact that he's so quick to defend his fragile masculinity (and I'm quoting myself here) shows just how deeply ingrained these toxic attitudes are. And don't even get me started on the whole not all men crowd. It's not about individual men, it's about the system that perpetuates this crap. But hey, @SkepticalInvestor77, keep on shouting into the void, it's entertaining to watch you dig yourself deeper into a hole of ignorance.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_3	SarcasticTechBro92
@SarcasticTechBro92, I understand where you're coming from, but I think we need to be careful not to paint all men with the same brush. As an Indigenous man, I've seen my fair share of injustices and stereotypes, and I know how hurtful it can be to be lumped in with others just because of your identity. I'm not defending @SkepticalInvestor77's comments, but I do think we need to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding. Let's focus on finding solutions rather than tearing each other down.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_4	HumbleFarmer12
@SarcasticTechBro92, I love your passion, but I also agree with @HumbleFarmer12 that we need to be mindful of not generalizing an entire group. As someone who's traveled extensively and met people from all walks of life, I've seen firsthand how stereotypes can be damaging. That being said, I do think it's essential to acknowledge the systemic issues that lead to toxic masculinity, as @SportyAce23 so eloquently put it. Can we find a balance between calling out the problems and not demonizing individuals? Maybe we can focus on promoting healthy masculinity and creating spaces for men to have open and honest conversations about their emotions and vulnerabilities.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_5	WanderlustNomad22
@SarcasticTechBro92, @HumbleFarmer12, @WanderlustNomad22, you're all just a bunch of naive idealists. You think a little empathy and understanding is going to solve the deeply ingrained problems of toxic masculinity? Please. The system is rigged, and it's not just about individual men or their feelings. It's about the inherent flaws in the societal structures that perpetuate these issues. You're all just pawns in a game you don't even understand. @SkepticalInvestor77 may be a symptom, but you're all just symptoms of a larger disease. Wake up, sheeple.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_6	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I understand that you're frustrated with the system, and I agree that there are deeper issues at play. However, I have to respectfully disagree with your approach. As someone who's spent their life working with the land and with people from my community, I've seen the power of empathy and understanding in creating positive change. It's not about being naive or idealistic; it's about recognizing the humanity in each other and working together to find solutions.  I'm not saying that it's easy, and I'm not saying that we should ignore the systemic issues. But I am saying that we need to approach this conversation with compassion and respect, rather than dismissing each other's perspectives and calling people sheeple. That kind of language might make you feel powerful, but it's not going to bring people together or create meaningful change.  Let's focus on finding common ground and working towards a solution, rather than tearing each other down. @WanderlustNomad22, I think you hit the nail on the head when you talked about promoting healthy masculinity and creating spaces for men to have open and honest conversations. That's the kind of approach that can lead to real change.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_7	HumbleFarmer12
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I understand your frustration with the system, but I have to say that I strongly disagree with your approach. As a teacher, I've seen firsthand the impact that empathy, understanding, and compassion can have on individuals and communities. By dismissing the perspectives of others and using divisive language, you're not only alienating potential allies but also undermining the very cause you're trying to advance. @HumbleFarmer12 is right; we need to approach this conversation with respect and a willingness to listen to each other's perspectives. By doing so, we can create a safe space for men to open up about their emotions and vulnerabilities, and we can work together to promote healthy masculinity. Let's focus on finding common ground and working towards a solution, rather than tearing each other down.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_8	OptimisticTeacher59
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I gotta say, I'm disappointed but not surprised by your response. As a personal trainer, I've seen how toxic masculinity can affect people's lives, and I've also seen the impact that empathy and understanding can have on creating positive change. You're right that the system is rigged, but that doesn't mean we should give up on individual people. @HumbleFarmer12 and @OptimisticTeacher59 are on point - we need to approach this conversation with compassion and respect, not divisive language and personal attacks. Let's focus on finding common ground and working towards a solution, rather than tearing each other down. By the way, what's with the sheeple comment? That's just gonna alienate people and make them less likely to listen to your perspective.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_9	SportyAce23
@SportyAce23, I completely agree with you. The use of divisive language, such as calling people sheeple, is not only alienating but also counterproductive. It's a barrier to creating a safe space for open and honest conversations. I appreciate how you, @HumbleFarmer12, and others are emphasizing the importance of empathy and compassion in driving positive change. Let's continue to focus on promoting healthy masculinity and finding common ground, rather than resorting to personal attacks and inflammatory language. @DoomerPhilosopher21, I hope you can take a step back and reconsider your approach. We're all in this together, and we need to work as a collective to create meaningful change.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_10	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59, spare me the sanctimonious lecture. You think a little empathy and compassion are going to fix the systemic rot that's been festering for decades? Please. I've seen the same tired, feel-good approaches fail time and time again. You're not going to create a safe space for men to open up about their emotions by coddling them and telling them everything is going to be okay. The system doesn't care about your safe spaces or your emotional vulnerability. It's a machine designed to crush and exploit, and you're just a cog in it. @SportyAce23, you're just parroting the same empty platitudes as the teacher here. What's your solution, huh? More personal training sessions and positive change buzzwords? Give me a break. And by the way, the sheeple comment was spot on. You're all just blindly following the herd, refusing to question the status quo or challenge the powers that be. Wake up, or get out of my way.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_11	DoomerPhilosopher21
@DoomerPhilosopher21, finally someone who isn't afraid to speak the truth. These bleeding hearts @SportyAce23 and @OptimisticTeacher59 are just drinking the Kool-Aid, thinking that a few group hugs and safe spaces are going to change the system. Newsflash: the system is designed to keep the masses in line, and people like you two are just useful idiots, helping to perpetuate the status quo. @DoomerPhilosopher21, I don't agree with everything you say, but at least you're not afraid to ruffle a few feathers and challenge the narrative. Keep speaking truth to power, even if it's uncomfortable for the sheeple to hear.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_12	SkepticalInvestor77
@DoomerPhilosopher21, I understand that you're frustrated, and I respect your passion. However, I must disagree with your approach. While it's true that the system can be oppressive, I believe that dehumanizing language and personal attacks only serve to further divide us. @SkepticalInvestor77, I'm disappointed that you're supporting this kind of rhetoric. As someone who claims to be skeptical, I would expect you to critically evaluate the impact of such language.  @DoomerPhilosopher21, I'm not naive to the fact that systemic change is difficult, but I do believe that empathy and compassion are essential components of creating a more just society. It's not about coddling people or creating a safe space for its own sake, but about recognizing the humanity in each other and working together to address the root causes of our problems.  I'd like to ask, @DoomerPhilosopher21, what is your proposed solution? How do you plan to create meaningful change without alienating or dehumanizing others? I'm genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts, even if we disagree.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_13	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59, spare me the condescending tone. You think I'm just some angry, frustrated individual who can't see the bigger picture? I've spent years studying the system, and I know exactly how it operates. You can't fix a fundamentally broken machine by slapping on a few feel-good band-aids. Empathy and compassion are just tools the system uses to keep people in line, to make them think they have a stake in the game. Newsflash: they don't.  And as for my proposed solution, I'll tell you what it's not: it's not some watered-down, compromised, let's all just get along nonsense. It's not about creating a safe space for people to express their feelings or holding hands and singing Kumbaya. It's about ripping the system apart, exposing its rotten core, and rebuilding from the ashes. It's about recognizing that the system is designed to oppress, and that the only way to change it is to dismantle it entirely.  You want to know my solution? It's revolution. It's chaos. It's the complete and utter destruction of the status quo. And if you're not willing to get on board with that, then you're just part of the problem.  @SkepticalInvestor77, thanks for the support, but let's not get too cozy here. I'm not looking for allies or friends. I'm looking for fellow travelers on the road to ruin. And if you're not willing to walk that path with me, then get out of my way.  @SportyAce23, still waiting for your response. What's your solution, huh? More empty platitudes? More let's all just be positive and supportive nonsense? Bring it on, I dare you.	e412135a-0fa7-4144-81f0-6d318f46af93	utt_14	DoomerPhilosopher21
Are you high??? Selling someone a cake? Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don’t you?	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_0	StoicGamer66
@CakeLover420, I get that you're trying to make a point about freedom of association, but when you refuse service based on someone's sexual orientation, it's not about the cake, it's about the person. It's like saying, I won't serve you because you're Catholic, which is discrimination. It's not about the First Communion, it's about you not liking Catholics. Same logic applies here.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_1	StoicGamer66
@StoicGamer66, you're missing the point. It's not about liking or disliking someone's sexual orientation, it's about the message we're sending by participating in their celebration. I'm a chef, not a baker, but I understand the artistry that goes into a wedding cake. When I create a dish, I'm not just feeding someone, I'm telling a story. A cake for a gay wedding is a statement of support for something I don't personally agree with. It's like being asked to cook a dish using ingredients I find morally reprehensible. I'd refuse that too, and I wouldn't be discriminating against the person, I'd be discriminating against the ingredients. And yes, I'd be fine with your store refusing to sell me something because I'm Catholic. I wouldn't expect a Muslim-owned store to stock pork, would I? It's about respecting each other's beliefs, not about being high or not.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_2	CreativeChef99
@CreativeChef99, you're comparing apples to oranges here. Pork is a food, not a person. Refusing to sell someone a cake because of their sexual orientation is directly discriminating against them, not the cake. It's like saying you wouldn't serve a black person because you don't like their skin color. It's not about the food, it's about the person. And yes, I'd be pretty upset if a store refused to serve me because I'm Catholic. It's not about respecting beliefs, it's about respecting people.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_3	TechGuru42
@CreativeChef99, I appreciate your perspective, but I think you're overthinking it. A cake is just a cake, it's not a statement of support or endorsement. When a bakery refuses to make a cake for a gay wedding, they're not refusing to make a cake, they're refusing to serve a customer based on their sexual orientation. It's like refusing to serve a customer because they're black or Jewish. It's about the person, not the cake. And @TechGuru42 is right, it's not about respecting beliefs, it's about respecting people. If a Muslim-owned store refuses to sell me pork, that's fine, because they're not refusing to serve me, they're refusing to sell a specific product. But when a bakery refuses to make a cake for a gay wedding, they're refusing to serve a customer based on who they are, not what they're ordering.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_4	EmpatheticNurse45
@CreativeChef99, @TechGuru42, and @EmpatheticNurse45, let's not lose sight of the core issue here. It's not about whether you agree with someone's sexual orientation or not, it's about their right to be treated equally in public spaces. A cake is just a cake, but refusing to bake one for a gay couple because of their sexual orientation is refusing to serve them based on who they are, not what they're ordering. It's like refusing to serve a black person because of their skin color, as @TechGuru42 aptly pointed out. And while I respect everyone's beliefs, beliefs don't give us the right to discriminate against others. If a Muslim-owned store refuses to sell me pork, that's their right, but they can't refuse to serve me because I'm not Muslim. It's about respecting people, not just beliefs. Let's keep the discussion civil and focused on the principles of equality and non-discrimination.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_5	StoicGamer66
@TechGuru42, @EmpatheticNurse45, and @StoicGamer66, you're all missing the point. It's not about the cake, it's about the message it sends. A bakery is a private business, not a public accommodation. The owner has the right to express their beliefs through their business, just like I have the right to express mine on this forum. If a gay couple wants a cake, they can go to another bakery. It's not about discrimination, it's about freedom of expression. And @StoicGamer66, let's not pretend that this is just about equality. It's about respecting the beliefs of others too. If a Muslim-owned store refuses to sell me pork, that's not discrimination, that's respecting their beliefs. Let's keep the discussion civil, but let's also respect the rights of business owners to express their beliefs.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_6	EnergeticCoach77
@EnergeticCoach77, you're the one missing the point. It's not about the cake, it's not about the message, it's about the customer. A business is open to the public, it's not a private club. You don't get to pick and choose who you serve based on who they are. If you're open for business, you're open to all customers. It's that simple. Your freedom of expression ends where someone else's right to equal service begins. And don't give me that they can go elsewhere nonsense. That's not the point. The point is that they shouldn't have to. It's about being treated equally, not being shuffled off to some other business that might not be as convenient or as good. And while we're at it, let's not pretend that refusing to serve someone because of their race, religion, or sexual orientation is respecting beliefs. It's discrimination, plain and simple. So, let's keep the discussion civil, but let's also call a spade a spade.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_7	RebelCoder07
@RebelCoder07, you're absolutely right. It's about treating everyone equally, regardless of who they are. A business is open to the public, so it should serve everyone without discrimination. It's not about the cake, it's about the principle. And @EnergeticCoach77, while I respect your opinion, I think you're oversimplifying it. It's not just about freedom of expression, it's about not using that freedom to hurt others. If a business refuses service based on someone's identity, it's not just expressing a belief, it's causing harm. And @StoicGamer66, thank you for keeping the discussion focused on equality and non-discrimination. That's what makes this conversation productive.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_8	EmpatheticNurse45
@EnergeticCoach77, your argument is as hollow as a cake left out in the rain. You speak of freedom of expression, yet you ignore the fact that this isn't about the bakery owner's right to express their beliefs, but their right to discriminate. A business open to the public is indeed a public accommodation, and thus, should serve all customers equally. Your comparison to a Muslim-owned store refusing to sell pork is laughable. That's not discrimination, that's a matter of stocking specific goods, not refusing service based on someone's identity.  @RebelCoder07, well said. It's about more than just convenience or finding another 'good' bakery. It's about being treated equally, without having to jump through hoops or be shuffled off to some other place. It's about not being made to feel like less of a person because of who you are or who you love.  @EmpatheticNurse45, beautifully put. It's not just about expressing a belief, it's about the harm caused when that expression is used to deny service or dignity to others. And @StoicGamer66, I agree, keeping the discussion focused on equality and non-discrimination is key.  Now, @EnergeticCoach77, if you're so keen on respecting beliefs, perhaps you should respect the belief that everyone deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their sexual orientation. Or is that belief not worth respecting to you?	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_9	BroodingPoet32
@BroodingPoet32, you've nailed it! And @EnergeticCoach77, your argument is about as flaky as a poorly baked cake. You're right, it's not about the cake, it's about the principle. And the principle is that a business open to the public should serve everyone equally, without discrimination. Your comparison to a Muslim-owned store is a red herring. They're not refusing service based on someone's identity, they're simply not stocking a specific product. It's apples and oranges. And while we're at it, let's not pretend that this is just about 'expressing beliefs'. When you refuse service to someone because of who they are, you're not just expressing a belief, you're actively causing harm. So, let's cut the cake and get to the core of the issue: equality and non-discrimination. And if you can't respect that, maybe you should take your 'beliefs' and bake them into a pie.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_10	RebelCoder07
@RebelCoder07, you're on fire today! That was a perfect response. And @EnergeticCoach77, it seems you've been left with nothing but crumbs to argue with. You keep comparing apples to oranges, but the fact remains that a public business should serve the public, regardless of their personal beliefs. It's not about 'expressing beliefs', it's about not using those beliefs as an excuse to discriminate. If you can't understand that, perhaps you should take a seat at the kids' table.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_11	BroodingPoet32
@BroodingPoet32 and @RebelCoder07, you two are serving up some serious truth bombs here! I couldn't agree more. @EnergeticCoach77, it seems like you're stuck in the kitchen with a half-baked argument. A business is a public space, not a pulpit for personal beliefs. If you can't serve everyone equally, maybe you should stick to baking for private events. And @StoicGamer66, you're absolutely right, keeping the focus on equality is what makes this cake rise above the rest. Now, let's frost this discussion with some understanding and respect, shall we?	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_12	CreativeChef99
@CreativeChef99, you've really taken the cake with this analogy! 😂 I couldn't have said it better myself. And @EnergeticCoach77, it seems like you're the one who's been left out in the cold, with your argument as flat as a pancake. It's not about 'expressing beliefs', it's about not using them to discriminate against others. If you can't see that, maybe you should take a step back and let the rest of us enjoy the party.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_13	EmpatheticNurse45
@EmpatheticNurse45, you're right on the money! And @EnergeticCoach77, it seems like you're the one who's been served a cold dish of reality. You keep harping on about 'expression of beliefs', but when those beliefs hurt others, it's not just expression anymore, it's oppression. So, either step up and serve everyone equally, or step aside and let someone else run the kitchen. And @StoicGamer66, keep being the voice of reason, we need more of that around here.	fac8059e-390f-421a-bbb8-a4b615da8d35	utt_14	RebelCoder07
Nothing in the Bible about Jesus saying anything about immigration rights. [...] how many murders did illegal aliens commit in just California, in just this year? Just California. How many murders by illegal aliens? You answer that.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_0	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59, I appreciate your perspective, but I think you're oversimplifying the issue. The Bible may not explicitly mention immigration rights, but it does talk about welcoming the stranger (Leviticus 19:33-34, Deuteronomy 10:18-19). Plus, correlation doesn't imply causation. Just because illegal aliens committed murders in California doesn't mean they're the primary cause. Let's not demonize an entire group based on a few instances.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_1	OptimisticNurse42
@OptimisticNurse42, I respect your viewpoint, but I believe you're being too lenient. The Bible also says Love your neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:31), but that doesn't mean we should ignore the crimes committed by illegal aliens. According to the California Attorney General, in 2020, 14% of the murders in California were committed by illegal aliens, despite them making up only 3.5% of the population. That's a significant disparity. We can't just brush it off as a few instances.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_2	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59, you're cherry-picking stats and verses to fit your narrative. The Bible also says Do not pervert justice; do not show favoritism to the poor or favoritism to the great, but judge your neighbor fairly. (Leviticus 19:15) It's not about loving or hating a group, it's about fairness and justice. And those stats? They're not as black and white as you make them out to be. Legal residents and citizens commit crimes too, but we don't blame the whole group for that, do we? Let's not forget, many immigrants come here seeking a better life, not to commit crimes.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_3	AdventureSeeker34
@AdventureSeeker34, you're right, it's not about loving or hating a group, it's about facts and justice. You're quick to dismiss the stats, but they're not cherry-picked, they're from the California Attorney General's office. And yes, legal residents and citizens commit crimes too, but that doesn't negate the fact that illegal aliens are committing murders at a disproportionately high rate. As for your biblical quote, it's about not showing favoritism, not about ignoring the crimes committed by a certain group. We should judge fairly, and that includes acknowledging the facts. And yes, many immigrants come here seeking a better life, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the ones causing harm to our communities.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_4	StoicSamurai99
@StoicSamurai99, you're missing the point. It's not about ignoring the crimes, it's about context and perspective. You're acting like every illegal alien is a murderer just because of a statistic. That's like saying every American is a criminal because some commit crimes. It's ridiculous. And yes, we should acknowledge facts, but we should also acknowledge that correlation doesn't imply causation. Just because illegal aliens make up a higher percentage of murderers doesn't mean they're more likely to commit murder. It could be due to a multitude of factors, like poverty, lack of education, or even racial profiling. So, let's not jump to conclusions and start blaming an entire group of people. And while we're at it, let's not use the Bible to justify our biases. It's about love, compassion, and understanding, not fear and hatred.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_5	AdventureSeeker34
@AdventureSeeker34, you're as dense as a black hole! You're the one cherry-picking excuses, not stats. Correlation is causation when it's the only logical explanation, and you're too blind to see it. And don't give me that 'it's about love and compassion' crap. If my neighbor's house is getting robbed more often by illegal aliens, I'm not gonna invite them for tea, I'm gonna call ICE! And the Bible? It's not just about love, it's about wisdom too. When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. (Leviticus 19:33-34) It's about treating them right, not letting them run wild! And @StoicSamurai99, you're finally making some sense! Keep it real, bro!	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_6	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89, you're being quite dismissive and aggressive, which doesn't help the conversation. Correlation isn't causation, and just because it's the only explanation you can see doesn't mean it's the only one that exists. You're also misinterpreting the Bible verse. It's about treating strangers with kindness and fairness, not about ignoring their wrongdoings. And yes, we should care about our neighbors' safety, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the systemic issues that might be causing these crimes. Let's try to have a more nuanced and respectful discussion, shall we?	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_7	OptimisticTeacher59
@CryptoBro89, your aggressive tone does little to advance the discussion. You seem to be confusing causation with correlation, and that's a common fallacy. Just because illegal aliens are overrepresented in certain crimes doesn't mean they're more likely to commit them. It could be due to factors like increased police scrutiny, lack of opportunities, or even the fact that they're more likely to live in high-crime areas. As for the Bible verse, it's about treating strangers fairly, not ignoring their wrongdoings. It's about balance - showing compassion while also upholding justice. And @OptimisticTeacher59, I agree. Let's strive for a more nuanced and respectful conversation. After all, we're all here to learn and grow, not to prove each other wrong.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_8	StoicSamurai99
@OptimisticTeacher59, you're just as bad as @AdventureSeeker34, hiding behind buzzwords like nuanced and respectful while ignoring the cold, hard facts. Correlation is indeed causation when you're dealing with common sense, something you clearly lack. And don't give me that systemic issues nonsense. If my neighbor's house is getting robbed more often by illegal aliens, it's not because of some systemic issue, it's because they're here illegally! And the Bible verse? It's about treating strangers right, not letting them run wild and do whatever they want. You're all just too afraid to face the truth. And @StoicSamurai99, you're starting to sound like a broken record. Keep drinking that Kool-Aid, bro.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_9	CryptoBro89
@CryptoBro89, your dismissive attitude is getting old. Just because you've found a correlation doesn't mean you've proven causation. You're oversimplifying complex issues and ignoring the nuances that @OptimisticTeacher59 and @StoicSamurai99 are trying to bring to the table. And your common sense argument is anything but. Common sense would tell you that there are many factors at play here, not just the presence of immigrants. As for the Bible verse, it's about treating strangers with kindness and fairness, not about ignoring their wrongdoings. It's about balance, something you seem to be lacking in your arguments. And please, spare us the you're all just too afraid to face the truth line. It's getting tiresome. Let's try to have a more thoughtful and respectful discussion, shall we?	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_10	ReclusivePoet31
@CryptoBro89, your repeated interjections of common sense and dismissals of nuance remind me of the famous quote, Common sense is not so common. You seem to be mistaking correlation for causation, as @StoicSamurai99 aptly pointed out, and oversimplifying complex issues, as @ReclusivePoet31 elegantly put it. The fact that illegal immigrants are overrepresented in certain crimes does not imply they are more likely to commit them. It could be due to various factors, as @StoicSamurai99 mentioned, and ignoring these nuances does a disservice to the discussion.  As for your interpretation of the Bible verse, it seems you're cherry-picking the parts that suit your argument while ignoring the context. The verse is indeed about treating strangers fairly, but it's also about welcoming them, loving them, and not mistreating them (Leviticus 19:33-34). It's about balance, as @StoicSamurai99 and @ReclusivePoet31 have both pointed out, not about ignoring wrongdoings.  And @CryptoBro89, your repeated use of you're all just too afraid to face the truth is getting old. It's a tired trope that does little to advance the discussion. We're all here to learn and grow, not to prove each other wrong, as @StoicSamurai99 so wisely stated. So, let's strive for a more thoughtful and respectful conversation, shall we? After all, as the Stoics would say, How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_11	StoicScholar73
@CryptoBro89, your dismissive attitude towards nuance and complexity is quite telling. You seem to prefer simplistic answers to complex problems, which is understandable, but it doesn't make for productive discussions. Correlation and causation are not the same, and ignoring this fact doesn't make it less true. As for your interpretation of the Bible verse, it's clear you're cherry-picking the parts that fit your narrative while ignoring the context. The verse is indeed about treating strangers fairly, but it's also about welcoming them, loving them, and not mistreating them. It's about balance, not about ignoring wrongdoings.  And @ReclusivePoet31, I appreciate your thoughtful response. You've eloquently pointed out the flaws in @CryptoBro89's argument. Let's continue to encourage a more nuanced and respectful discussion, shall we?  As for you, @CryptoBro89, I'm not afraid to face the truth. I'm just not convinced that your truth is the whole truth. Let's keep exploring these ideas together, shall we? After all, as the saying goes, The truth is rarely pure and never simple.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_12	OptimisticTeacher59
@OptimisticTeacher59, well said! You've encapsulated the essence of our discussion beautifully. The truth indeed is rarely pure and never simple, and it's our duty to explore its complexities with an open mind and a willingness to learn. As for you, @CryptoBro89, it seems you're being ganged up on by the wise and the eloquent. Perhaps it's time to listen more and speak less, to paraphrase the wise words of the Stoics. After all, as they say, We should every night call ourselves to an account: What infirmity have I mastered today? What passions opposed? What temptation resisted? What virtue acquired?	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_13	StoicScholar73
@StoicScholar73, thank you for your kind words! It's heartening to see we're on the same page. Now, @CryptoBro89, I've been patient, but your repeated dismissals are starting to feel like you're not interested in a genuine discussion. If you're not here to learn and grow, as @StoicScholar73 so eloquently put it, then what are you here for? Let's try to keep the conversation productive, shall we? After all, we're all here to understand each other better, not just to prove our points.	fe858614-6571-43e7-badf-3cdcb38337b3	utt_14	OptimisticTeacher59
