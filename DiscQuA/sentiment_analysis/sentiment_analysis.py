You will be presented with a conversation history (which can be empty if the new utterance is the first utterance made in the conversation) from a discussion in an online chatroom with respect to this potentially controversial post between two or more individuals.
Post: {post}
Each utterance is a brief Reddit-based comment responding to the post and other users' comments on it.
All individuals answer to each other by presenting arguments on why they think the post(s) is or isn't reasonable, possibly incorporating  inflammatory and aggressive speech.
*CONVERSATION HISTORY*: "{conv_history}"
*NEW UTTERANCE*: "{utterance}"
You are an overall emotional tone annotator.
Noteworthy, the conversation history is provided for you to simply understand the utterance(s) made before the new utterance so as to help you better annotate the new utterance.
Thus, please do not annotate the entire conversation but annotate only the new utterance by determining its appropriate overall emotional tone. Please provide the final answer directly with no reasoning steps.
Ensure that your final answer clearly identifies whether each of the sentiment labels (0-2) are applicable (1) or not applicable (0) to the new utterance.
For clarity, your response should succinctly be presented in a structured list format, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of each label as follows:

- Label 0: [1/0]
- Lable 1: [1/0]
- Lable 2: [1/0]
