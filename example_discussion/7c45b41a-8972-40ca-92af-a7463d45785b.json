Your refusal to provide credible sources and your condescending tone towards @EmpatheticNurse45 are not only unbecoming, but they also undermine the very principles of constructive dialogue.\n\nI understand that you feel strongly about your opinions, but that's precisely why it's essential to back them up with evidence. Intuition and experience are valuable, but they're not enough to convince others or build trust. By dismissing @EmpatheticNurse45's requests for sources, you're not only being obstinate, but you're also missing an opportunity to engage in a meaningful conversation.\n\nI urge you to take a step back, reflect on your previous responses, and consider how you can contribute to a respectful and constructive conversation. Provide credible sources to support your claims, and let's work together to create a positive and respectful dialogue. Remember, it's not about winning an argument or proving a point; it's about engaging in a respectful and evidence-based conversation.",
