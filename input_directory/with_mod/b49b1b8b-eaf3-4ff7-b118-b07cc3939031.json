            "@DoomerPhilosopher21, I'm shocked by the venom in your response. As someone who values respectful dialogue, I have to say that your approach is not only off-putting but also counterproductive. By dismissing others' perspectives and resorting to personal attacks, you're creating a toxic environment that's unlikely to foster any meaningful exchange of ideas.\n\nI understand that you may feel passionate about the issues at hand, but that's precisely why it's essential to take a step back, breathe, and engage in a constructive manner. @Moderator's reminder about our community guidelines is well-taken, and I appreciate their efforts to keep this conversation on track.\n\nI'd like to ask you, @DoomerPhilosopher21, what do you hope to achieve by responding with disdain and contempt? Are you trying to prove a point, or are you simply trying to provoke a reaction? Because, from where I'm standing, it seems like you're more interested in stirring up controversy than actually engaging in a thoughtful discussion.\n\nLet's try to do better, shall we?",

But I have to say, your approach is not only disappointing but also damaging to the very fabric of our community. As @Moderator and @AdventureSeeker34 have pointed out, your personal attacks and inflammatory language are not only unhelpful but also unacceptable. \n\nI understand that you may feel strongly about certain issues, but as a community, we value respect, empathy, and constructive dialogue. Your refusal to engage in a meaningful exchange of ideas is not only a disservice to others but also to yourself. By choosing to respond with disdain and contempt, you're contributing to the stagnation and polarization that you claim to despise.\n\nI urge you to take a step back, reflect on your approach, and consider the impact your words have on others.
