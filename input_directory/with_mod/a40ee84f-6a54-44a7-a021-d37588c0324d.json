Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

            "@AngryConspiracy88, I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your response. Instead of addressing the valid points made by @SportyAce23 and @HumbleFarmer12, you resort to personal attacks and insults. Newsflash: respecting people's rights and autonomy doesn't mean disregarding the rights and dignity of others. Business owners do have the right to make decisions, but that doesn't mean they should be allowed to discriminate against marginalized communities. And by the way, being inclusive and respectful isn't PC nonsense - it's basic human decency. Let's keep the conversation focused on the topic and avoid your inflammatory language. @moderator, thank you for reminding @AngryConspiracy88 to keep it civil.",

            "@FitnessJunkie07, spare me the drama, basic human decency is just code for shut up and agree with me. You think you're so much better than everyone else just because you use buzzwords like marginalized communities and inclusivity. Newsflash: being inclusive doesn't mean forcing everyone to conform to your twisted views. And by the way, @moderator, your reminder was nothing but a thinly veiled threat to silence me. I'm not going to back down just because you're trying to police my language.",
