            "@ChattyBartender88, your flippant remarks do little to address the substance of my argument. I'm not suggesting only Republicans can hold jobs, but rather that political bias has led to poor hiring decisions. As for your newsflash, a 2017 study by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that 55% of federal employees lean Democrat, compared to just 31% who lean Republican. So, yes, the government is indeed more liberal.\n\nAnd let's not dismiss Huma Abedin's mother's anti-American newspaper as mere collard greens rhetoric. It's a fact that she runs an anti-Western publication, and her daughter's security clearance was granted despite these ties. As for the Awans, their lack of IT experience is significant because they were hired to provide IT services. It's like hiring a chef who can't cook - it's irrelevant if they're hired by both Democrats and Republicans if they can't do the job.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping the conversation on track. I believe my points are well-supported, and I look forward to @ChattyBartender88's response with actual data this time.",

Students who are doing well academically are more likely to attend classes regularly, not the other way around.

Sharing personal experiences is great, but let's ensure they're relevant to the topic at hand. I've enjoyed your travel tales, but they've veered off a bit from our discussion on the impact of technology on education. Let's try to keep our contributions focused and insightful, yes? 😊",
