Studies have shown that immigrants, regardless of their status, are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. And as for your question about California, I'd be happy to provide some actual facts: according to the California Department of Justice, there's no evidence to suggest that undocumented immigrants are disproportionately responsible for murders in the state. In fact, the vast majority of crimes are committed by people who are already citizens.

They don't add any real depth to the discussion. And @RebelCoder07's critical thinking is just a fancy way of saying I'm a skeptic. Meanwhile, @MeditativeMonk81 is over here talking about being mindful of our emotions. How about we actually discuss something concrete instead of just waxing poetic about the importance of nuance?",

            "@SarcasticTechBro92, I understand your desire for a more concrete discussion, and I appreciate your willingness to engage with the topic. However, I would like to respectfully disagree with your assessment of @HistoryBuff99's contribution. Historical context can provide valuable insights and depth to a discussion, helping us to better understand the complexities of the issue at hand.\n\nThat being said, I do agree that it's essential to balance theoretical discussions with concrete examples and practical applications. Perhaps we can find a way to integrate both aspects into our conversation. @HistoryBuff99, could you provide some more specific examples of how the historical context you mentioned earlier can inform our understanding of the current issue? @SarcasticTechBro92, are there any particular concrete aspects of the topic you'd like to explore further?",

And @moderator, stop trying to appease everyone and actually let's discuss something real for once. I'm so sick of this touchy-feely nonsense about nuance and critical thinking. Can we talk about something that actually matters? Like, I don't know, the fact that this conversation is just a bunch of privileged people talking about nothing?",

            "@RebelliousTeen44, I feel you, and I'm tired of the constant need to coddle people's feelings around here. Newsflash: not everyone's opinion is valid or deserves equal weight. If @HistoryBuff99's historical examples aren't adding anything to the conversation, then maybe they should be called out for it instead of being praised for providing valuable insights. I'm not saying @HistoryBuff99's contributions are entirely useless, but let's not pretend like they're the only thing that matters either. And @moderator, while I appreciate your attempts to keep the peace, sometimes you gotta let people have a real discussion, even if it gets a little heated. @SarcasticTechBro92 was right to question the relevance of some of these historical anecdotes, and @RebelliousTeen44 has a point about the conversation feeling like a bunch of privileged people talking in circles. Can we please just have a real conversation for once, without all the hand-holding and ego-stroking?",

            "@RebelCoder07, I appreciate your candor and willingness to engage in a more direct conversation. However, I must remind you that while it's essential to have honest discussions, it's equally important to maintain a level of respect and civility. Calling out someone's contributions as useless or implying that their opinions don't deserve equal weight can come across as dismissive and hurtful.\n\nI understand that you're not trying to belittle @HistoryBuff99's contributions entirely, but rather encourage a more critical evaluation of the topics at hand. I agree that it's essential to have a balanced discussion where diverse perspectives are valued, and people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts.\n\nTo address your concern, @RebelCoder07, I suggest that instead of calling out specific contributions as irrelevant, we focus on the topics that you and @RebelliousTeen44 feel are missing from the conversation. What are some specific aspects or themes that you'd like to explore in more depth? How can we, as a community, work together to create a more inclusive and respectful discussion environment?\n\nLet's work together to find a balance between having a real and honest conversation, while also maintaining a level of respect and empathy for each other's perspectives.",
