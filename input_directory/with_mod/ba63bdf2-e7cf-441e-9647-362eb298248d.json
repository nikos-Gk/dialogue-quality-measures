            "@SarcasticTechBro92, thank you for sharing your perspective. It's clear that you have some valid concerns about Source 2. However, I noticed that your response also included some personal attacks, which can make it harder for others to engage with your arguments. Could you help us focus the discussion by highlighting one or two specific issues with the methodology or authors' conflicts of interest that you find most problematic? This way, we can all better understand your perspective and engage in a more productive conversation.",

            "Well, @SarcasticTechBro92, I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen folks like you before. You're quick to dismiss others' views and hide behind your sources while ignoring the bigger picture. You talk about methodology and conflicts of interest, but you're the one who's cherry-picking here, ignoring the consensus from the vast majority of studies.\n\nAnd @RebelliousTeen44, you're right to call out @SarcasticTechBro92's attitude. It's one thing to have differing opinions, but it's another to dismiss others as ignorant without proper reasoning. We're all here to learn and grow, not just to prove ourselves right.\n\nNow, @SarcasticTechBro92, instead of throwing around insults, why don't you tell us what you think the rest of us are missing? What's the one thing that, if we understood it, would change our minds? And remember, no need to be rude about it. We're all adults here.",
