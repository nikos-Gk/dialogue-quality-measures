From the Benghazi fiasco to the countless security leaks, it's clear they can't even keep their own house in order. And don't even get me started on the Clinton email scandal. As for the Awans, they were literally stealing from the government while having access to sensitive information. But sure, let's just ignore that because they're not automatically terrorists.\n\n@WanderlustNomad22, your cousin might be a world traveler, but that doesn't make them an expert on national security. The Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of supporting terrorism, and pretending they're all moderate is just wishful thinking.

When you use complex terms without explanation, it can alienate those who are less familiar with the topic. It's not about dumbing down the conversation, but rather making it more inclusive. I've seen you do this before, and it's always been well-received when you take the time to explain. Let's make this conversation accessible to everyone, shall we? After all, we're all here to learn and grow together.",
