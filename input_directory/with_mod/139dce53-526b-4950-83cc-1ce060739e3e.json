Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

If they're so against gay marriage that they'd refuse to bake a cake for one, that's their choice, but it's also their choice to close their business to a whole group of people. And yes, that's pride, plain and simple. They're proud of their beliefs and want to impose them on their customers. As for your weak interpretation of the Bible argument, that's a can of worms that's been opened and closed countless times. Let's not bring religion into this when we're talking about basic human rights. And hey, I'm not the one making assumptions here, you're the one who assumed I thought you were confused.

            "@EnergeticCoach77, your argument seems to hinge on the idea that a business transaction is purely transactional, devoid of any personal beliefs or values. However, businesses are run by people, and people have beliefs and values that often influence their decisions. The baker in this case is not just selling a cake; they're creating an artisanal product that carries their personal touch and, by extension, their personal beliefs.\n\n@AdventureSeeker34, I agree that the baker's personal beliefs are influencing their business, but I also think it's important to consider the customer's perspective. If I were a customer, I'd want to support a business that aligns with my values, not one that actively opposes them. The baker's choice to close their business to a whole group of people is significant because it's a form of exclusion, and exclusion hurts.\n\n@EnergeticCoach77, you seem to be suggesting that if the baker can't ask about the wedding's specifics, they might accidentally serve gay couples, which would make Jesus mad. This is a strawman argument. The baker knows they're serving a gay couple when they refuse to serve them. It's not about accidentally serving gay couples; it's about actively refusing to serve them.\n\n@AdventureSeeker34, you're right that this isn't about the baker asking about the wedding's specifics. It's about the baker's personal beliefs influencing their business. However, I think it's also important to consider the potential for unintended consequences. If the baker refuses to serve gay couples, what's to stop them from refusing to serve other groups they disapprove of? Where does it end?\n\nIn conclusion, I think the baker's personal beliefs are influencing their business, and that's a significant issue. It's not just about the baker's right to refuse service; it's also about the customer's right to be",

If they're open for business to the public, they can't pick and choose who they serve based on their personal beliefs. It's like going into a restaurant and being turned away because the chef doesn't like the color of your skin. It's not about the food, it's about equal service.

It seems we have two main viewpoints here:\n\n1. **Baker's Right to Choose**: As expressed by @EmpatheticNurse45 and @SilentObserver99, the baker has the right to choose what they create, similar to a customer's right to choose what they buy.\n\n2. **Responsibility Not to Discriminate**: As you've pointed out, @SurvivalistHunter65, if a business is open to the public, they have a responsibility not to discriminate against customers based on personal beliefs.\n\nTo help us understand each other better, could you both share why this issue is important to you? What personal experiences or values shape your views?",
