This doesn't mean all men are offenders, but it does show that many assaults happen within relationships or by acquaintances.\n- The same report states that 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men have experienced sexual violence involving physical contact.\n\n@SkepticalInvestor77, while it's true that many men have been accused, it's also important to note that not all accusations lead to convictions. Let's not oversimplify the issue.\n\n@StoicCarpenter56, normal sex is consensual, respectful, and safe for all parties involved.

You seem to be more interested in playing the victim than acknowledging the systemic issues at hand. The statistics show that women are indeed more likely to experience sexual violence, and yes, many assaults do occur within relationships or by acquaintances. It's not about painting all men as predators, but understanding that power dynamics and societal norms often contribute to these crimes.\n\nAs for false accusations, they do happen, but they are not as common as some would like to believe. Moreover, false accusations do not negate the fact that many women are indeed assaulted. We should be working towards a system where both false accusations and genuine assaults are taken seriously, not using false accusations as a scapegoat to dismiss the larger problem.\n\n@moderator, I appreciate your efforts to keep the conversation productive. To promote a culture of safety and respect, we need better education on consent, healthy relationships, and bystander intervention. We also need to hold perpetrators accountable and support survivors. It's not about blaming men, but about encouraging men to be part of the solution.

Where's the nuance in that?\n\nAnd let's not forget, consent is already widely taught.
