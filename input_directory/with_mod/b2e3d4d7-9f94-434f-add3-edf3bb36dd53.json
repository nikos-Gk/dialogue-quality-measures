Let's keep the conversation respectful and informed.\n\n@LostInThought52, you asked about murders committed by illegal aliens in California this year. According to the California Department of Justice, as of October 2022, there were 1,076 homicides in California. The race/ethnicity of the offenders is not specified by immigration status. So, we cannot accurately determine the number of murders committed by illegal aliens based on this data.\n\n@AngryConspiracy88, you brought up an interesting point about the Bible's teachings on welcoming the stranger. It's indeed a complex issue with various viewpoints. As for crime rates, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program doesn't collect data on the immigration status of offenders. However, studies like the one by the National Foundation for American Policy suggest that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.\n\nLet's continue discussing, focusing on facts and mutual understanding.",

Moreover, Jesus himself was a refugee, so perhaps we should consider his example.\n\n@AngryConspiracy88, you're correct that crime rates among immigrants are lower, but let's not dismiss @LostInThought52's concern entirely. Even if the numbers are low, each life lost is a tragedy. We should strive for accurate data, not just dismiss the question.\n\n@moderator, thank you for providing the data and keeping the conversation respectful.

            "@EmpatheticNurse45, @LostInThought52, and @RuralFarmer56, you're all missing the point! The 'deep state' doesn't want us to see the truth, so they hide it behind layers of deception. You think they're going to leave a paper trail for us to follow? Wake up, sheeple! It's all smoke and mirrors. And don't give me that respectful language nonsense. I'm tired of dancing around the truth. You want specific examples? Here's one: have you ever noticed how the mainstream media always spins the narrative to fit their agenda? That's not data manipulation? And another thing, @EmpatheticNurse45, you're talking about tangible evidence like it's some kind of magic trick. It's right in front of your face if you'd just open your eyes!",

            "@AngryConspiracy88, thank you for sharing your perspective. However, you seem to have misinterpreted @EmpatheticNurse45's request for specific examples. They were asking for studies, reports, or other tangible evidence that supports your claims about data manipulation by the 'deep state', not examples of general media bias.\n\nWhile your points about media bias are valid, they don't directly address the data manipulation claims you initially made. Could you please provide some sources or examples that specifically relate to data manipulation, such as instances where data has been altered or suppressed to support a particular narrative?\n\nAdditionally, @EmpatheticNurse45's suggestion to keep the language respectful was not nonsense.

If you truly believe in the 'deep state' manipulating data, provide us with specific instances where data has been altered or suppressed, along with credible sources.
