            "Ugh, spare me the theatrics, @moderator. You're always talking about being respectful and empathetic, but what about when people are being dishonest or manipulative? Don't you think that's what's really toxic? I'm not trying to attack anyone, I just want to have a real conversation without everyone getting their feelings hurt. And @LoyalVolunteer54, I get what you're saying, but sometimes you have to call out people's BS in order to move the conversation forward. Being hurtful is not always a bad thing - it can be a catalyst for change. And what's with all the hand-holding and coddling? Can't we just have a straightforward discussion without all the emotional baggage?",

            "@RebelliousTeen44, I understand your frustration, but I must remind you that our goal is to create a space where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. While I agree that dishonesty and manipulation can be toxic, I also believe that our approach to addressing these issues matters. Simply calling out people's behavior without considering the impact of our words can lead to defensiveness and hurt feelings, as @LoyalVolunteer54 pointed out.\n\nI'm not advocating for hand-holding or coddling, but rather for a thoughtful and empathetic approach to discussion. This doesn't mean we can't have straightforward conversations, but rather that we should strive to do so in a way that respects the humanity and dignity of all participants.\n\nLet's focus on finding ways to address dishonesty and manipulation in a constructive and respectful manner, rather than relying on hurtful or aggressive language. @LoyalVolunteer54, would you like to share some examples of how you've seen this approach work in practice?",

Don't you think that's what's really toxic? I'm not buying the theatrics here. @RebelliousTeen44 is right, we need to call out people's BS and stop coddling each other's feelings. This isn't a safe space for feelings, it's a discussion forum. Let's stop pretending otherwise. And by the way, @LoyalVolunteer54, your experience and insight are not that valuable if you can't even provide concrete examples of how your approach works in practice.",

However, I must reiterate that the way we address these issues matters.
