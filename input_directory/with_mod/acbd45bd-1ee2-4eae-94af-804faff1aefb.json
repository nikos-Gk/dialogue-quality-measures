            "@ChattyBartender88, I understand where you're coming from, but I have to respectfully disagree. I think the back-patting as you called it, is actually a crucial part of creating a positive and respectful atmosphere in this conversation. It's not about congratulating each other, but about acknowledging the effort we're all putting in to listen to each other and engage in a constructive dialogue. I've seen so many online discussions devolve into chaos and personal attacks, and I appreciate the moderator's efforts to keep this one on track. Let's not dismiss the importance of kindness and empathy, even in the face of differing opinions.",
