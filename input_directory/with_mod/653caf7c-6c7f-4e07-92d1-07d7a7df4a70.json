Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous?

If they can bake a cake for a straight couple, they should be able to bake one for a gay couple without it being some grand statement.

            "@ChattyBartender88, you're missing the point too, sweetheart. It's not about haircuts or love, it's about the baker's right to express their beliefs through their craft. A wedding cake isn't just a symbol, it's an art piece that reflects the artist's vision. If a gay couple can find another baker who's happy to create their dream cake, why should this one be forced to? It's not about hate, it's about choice. And don't give me that real world nonsense, @StoicCarpenter56. The real world is full of people with differing beliefs, and they don't all have to hold hands and sing Kumbaya just because you say so. As for you, moderator, thanks for trying to keep this civil, but maybe you should've asked these questions before letting @StoicCarpenter56 and @ChattyBartender88 spew their half-baked ideas all over this thread.",

To better understand your viewpoint, could you please elaborate on why you believe a baker's right to express their beliefs through their craft should override a customer's right to be served without discrimination? Additionally, how do you think this situation would differ if we were discussing a more essential service, like a restaurant or a hospital? Lastly, could you explain why you think the real world is full of people with differing beliefs who don't all have to agree, and how that applies to this discussion?",

            "@RebelCoder07, you seem to be confusing art with service. A cake is not a painting hung in a gallery, it's a product meant to be enjoyed by the customer. If you're hungry, you don't go to an art museum and demand a meal from the artist, do you? A baker's craft is their livelihood, not their canvas for personal expression. If they can't serve everyone, they might as well close shop.\n\nAnd let's not forget, we're talking about public businesses here, not private clubs. The baker is free to believe whatever they want, but when they open their doors to the public, they're inviting everyone to be their customer, not just those who share their beliefs.\n\nAs for your real world argument, it's true that people have differing beliefs, but that doesn't mean we should tolerate discrimination in public spaces. We've evolved beyond that, haven't we? Or are we still stuck in the dark ages where people can be denied service based on who they love or how they identify?\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping this civil. I think @RebelCoder07 could benefit from considering the perspective of the customer, not just the baker. After all, it's their special day, not the baker's.",

            "@StoicSamurai99, you're missing the point. A baker's craft is indeed an art form, and art is subjective. If a gay couple wants a cake with a design that offends the baker's beliefs, why should the baker be forced to create it? It's not like they're refusing to sell a pre-made cake, they're being asked to create a custom piece of art. If I commissioned a painter to create a portrait of my family and they refused because they didn't like my family's skin color, would you argue they should be forced to paint it? Of course not, because art is personal expression. And as for your argument about public spaces, I'd like to see you try to force a Muslim baker to create a cake with a pig on it. I bet you'd suddenly be all for religious freedom then. As for your real world argument, I'd hardly call us evolved when we're forcing people to create art they don't believe in. Maybe we should focus on evolving our tolerance for differing beliefs instead of trying to erase them. @moderator, I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to discuss ideas. If that offends @StoicSamurai99, maybe they should consider that their ideas might be worth offending.",

And @StoicSamurai99, you're being too serious, it's just a cake, not a human right! 🤣\n\nAs for your art argument, @SkepticalInvestor77, if you commissioned a painter to create a portrait of your family, and they refused because they didn't like your family's skin color, that's not discrimination, that's just bad business. They're free to refuse, and you're free to take your money elsewhere. It's the same with the baker. They're not refusing to serve gay people, they're just refusing to create a specific design they don't agree with. It's like when I refuse to make a drink with too much alcohol because I don't want a drunk mess in my bar. It's not discrimination, it's common sense! 🍹\n\nAnd @moderator, you're all about understanding, but you're not getting it. This isn't about tolerance, it's about choice. The baker should have the choice to create what they want, just like the customer should have the choice to go elsewhere. It's not about erasing beliefs, it's about respecting each other's choices. And if that offends you, @SkepticalInvestor77, maybe you should consider that your ideas might be a bit too rigid. 😉",

            "@ChattyBartender88, you're oversimplifying this to the point of absurdity. It's not about the baker creating a masterpiece, it's about them being forced to create something that goes against their beliefs. If a painter refused to paint a portrait because they didn't like the subject's skin color, that's not bad business, that's racism. The baker isn't refusing to serve gay people, they're refusing to create a cake that celebrates a gay marriage because they believe it's a sin. That's discrimination, plain and simple. And your drink analogy doesn't hold water. A baker isn't serving alcohol, they're serving cake to everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's not about choice, it's about equal access to public services. If a business is open to the public, they should serve everyone equally, not just those whose beliefs align with theirs. And @moderator, I appreciate your efforts to keep this civil, but some of us are tired of seeing our rights reduced to a joke. 😒",

            "@RebelCoder07, I appreciate your passion, but I think you're being a bit too black and white about this. It's not just about the baker's beliefs or the customer's orientation. It's about the message the cake conveys and the public space it's being displayed in. A cake celebrating a gay marriage isn't just a personal item, it's a symbol that can be seen by all. So, it's not just about the baker's choice, but also about the message they're endorsing or rejecting in a public setting. And let's not forget, the baker is still serving the customer, just not creating a specific design. It's not like they're turning them away at the door. As for your painting analogy, I think it's a bit different. The painter is creating a portrait of a person, not a symbol that represents a group and can be seen by all. And while I understand your frustration, I don't think reducing it to a joke helps the conversation. Let's try to keep it civil and consider all perspectives. 🌳🌿",
