Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

            "@CryptoBro89, I must remind you that personal attacks and insults are not acceptable in this discussion. Your response to @SurvivalistHunter65 was not constructive and did not contribute to a respectful dialogue. I understand that you have strong opinions, but it's essential to express them in a way that is respectful to others.\n\nYour suggestion of financial penalties for businesses that don't conform to the network's ideals is a valid point, and I encourage you to elaborate on that idea in a respectful manner.\n\nHowever, I must warn you that continued personal attacks and insults will not be tolerated. I encourage you to rephrase your response to @SurvivalistHunter65 and focus on the discussion at hand, rather than making personal attacks.\n\n@SurvivalistHunter65, I appreciate your patience and willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue. Please let's focus on the topic at hand and work together to find common ground.\n\nLet's continue the discussion in a respectful and constructive manner.",

I have to say, I'm disappointed in the way you're choosing to express yourself. Your opinions are valid, but your attitude is not. We're all here to learn from each other and find common ground, not to tear each other down. I understand that you're passionate about your ideas, but passion doesn't have to equal aggression. Let's try to keep the discussion civil and respectful, even when we disagree. @Moderator, I appreciate your efforts to keep the conversation on track. Let's all take a deep breath and try to do better.",
