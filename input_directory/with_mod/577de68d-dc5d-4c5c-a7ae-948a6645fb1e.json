However, I must remind you that our community guidelines emphasize the importance of respectful dialogue and the use of credible sources to support claims.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that you may have concerns about the mainstream media and government agencies, it's essential to recognize that Alex Jones is a controversial figure who has been known to spread misinformation and conspiracy theories. Relying solely on his sources may not provide a balanced or accurate understanding of the topic.\n\nI'm not asking you to provide sources to maintain the status quo or keep people in the dark. Rather, I'm encouraging you to engage in a constructive discussion by sharing credible sources that can be verified and evaluated by others. This is essential for building trust and fostering a respectful environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their perspectives.\n\nI would like to reiterate my previous request: please provide credible sources that support your concerns about the FBI's reliability. This will help us to have a more informed discussion and allow others to engage with your perspective in a meaningful way.\n\nLet's work together to maintain a respectful and open environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their perspectives.",

            "@AngryConspiracy88, I've seen this kind of rhetoric before, and it's getting old. You claim to be a truth-seeker, but when asked for credible sources, you resort to name-dropping Alex Jones, a known purveyor of misinformation. That's not how you build a credible argument. If you're genuinely interested in having a fact-based discussion, then provide us with some actual evidence, not just conspiracy theories and unverifiable claims. And by the way, if you're so confident in your truth, then why are you so resistant to providing credible sources to back it up? It's because you know that your sources won't hold up to scrutiny, and you're trying to avoid being called out on it. @moderator is right; we need to maintain a respectful and open environment, and that means engaging in constructive dialogue, not just shouting conspiracy theories from the rooftops.",
