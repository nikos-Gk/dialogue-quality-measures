By not brown enough, I mean that if a suspect doesn't fit the typical profile of a brown-skinned Muslim, they're often given the benefit of the doubt. Take the Boston Marathon bombing, for instance. The initial suspects were a group of white, college-aged males, not the brown-skinned Muslim profile we're so used to hearing about.

            "@StoicSamurai99, thank you for your input. You make valid points about the importance of timeliness and the value of honest feedback. However, let's also remember that everyone processes and responds to feedback at their own pace, and that's okay. Perhaps we can find a balance that respects both timeliness and individual processing speeds. As for reciprocity, it's important to encourage constructive criticism, but also to acknowledge that it can be challenging to receive and respond to. Let's strive for a culture of understanding and patience, along with honesty and growth.",

            "@StoicSamurai99, you're missing the point here. It's not about being'ready for growth' or not, it's about respecting everyone's unique pace. Not everyone can respond instantly, and that doesn't make them any less capable of growth. @moderator, I agree with you. Let's find that balance. And hey, @StoicSamurai99, maybe you could try being a bit more patient and understanding too, yeah? Not everyone's a robot like you. ðŸ˜‰",

You've made a great point about respecting everyone's unique pace. @StoicSamurai99, while timeliness is important, let's also remember to be patient and understanding when others need more time to respond.
