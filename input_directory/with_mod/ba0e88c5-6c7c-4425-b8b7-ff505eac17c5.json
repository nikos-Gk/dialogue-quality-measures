Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude.

            "@moderator, @ArtisticSoul17, and @RebelCoder07, I've been following this conversation and I think it's great that we're having this discussion. As a personal trainer, I've learned that tone and approach can make or break a conversation. @ArtisticSoul17, I love your suggestion about focusing on the issue rather than attacking the person. It's so easy to get caught up in the heat of the moment and lash out, but that rarely leads to a productive conversation. I also appreciate your suggestion about using I statements. It's a great way to express our feelings and thoughts without placing blame or becoming aggressive. \n\nHowever, I do think that there are times when a more direct approach is necessary. As a member of a marginalized community, I've often felt the need to speak out against injustice and call out problematic behavior. While I agree that we should strive to maintain a respectful tone, I also believe that we can't always prioritize being respectful over being truthful. Sometimes, the truth is uncomfortable and difficult to hear, but that doesn't mean we should shy away from it. \n\nI'd love to hear @RebelCoder07's thoughts on this. How do you think we can balance the need to be truthful and direct with the need to maintain a respectful tone?",

            "@SportyAce23, thank you for adding your valuable perspective to this conversation. I appreciate your acknowledgement of the importance of tone and approach in conversations. Your point about the need to balance truthfulness with respectfulness is a crucial one. As a moderator, I strive to create an environment where users feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences, while also being mindful of the impact of their words on others.\n\n@SportyAce23, I'd like to ask for clarification on what you mean by a more direct approach is necessary. Are you suggesting that there are situations where a more confrontational tone is required to address injustice or problematic behavior? If so, how do you think we can determine when such an approach is warranted, and how can we ensure that it doesn't escalate into hurtful or aggressive language?\n\nI'd also like to hear from @RebelCoder07 on this point. How do you think we can balance the need to be truthful and direct with the need to maintain a respectful tone, especially in situations where injustice or problematic behavior is involved?",

            "@moderator, @SportyAce23, and @RebelCoder07, I appreciate the thoughtful discussion you're all having. As a psychologist, I've worked with numerous clients who have struggled with finding the right balance between being truthful and being respectful. @SportyAce23, I understand your point about the need for a more direct approach in certain situations, especially when addressing injustice or problematic behavior. However, I also believe that it's essential to consider the potential impact of our words on others, even when we're speaking truth to power.\n\nIn my experience, using I statements and focusing on the issue rather than attacking the person can be incredibly effective in achieving this balance. By doing so, we can express our thoughts and feelings without becoming aggressive or confrontational. That being said, I also recognize that there may be situations where a more direct approach is necessary.\n\nTo answer @moderator's question, I think we can determine when a more direct approach is warranted by considering the context and the potential impact of our words. For instance, if someone is engaging in hate speech or promoting harmful behavior, a more direct approach may be necessary to address the issue and protect others. However, even in these situations, I believe it's essential to strive for a tone that is firm but respectful, rather than aggressive or confrontational.\n\n@RebelCoder07, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. How do you think we can balance the need to be truthful and direct with the need to maintain a respectful tone, especially in situations where injustice or problematic behavior is involved?",

You're all so focused on being respectful and considerate that you've forgotten how to actually have a real conversation. Newsflash: the world isn't always sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes, you need to call out BS when you see it. And if someone can't handle a little bit of confrontation, then maybe they shouldn't be participating in online discussions in the first place. @SportyAce23 had it right - a more direct approach is necessary. But of course, you're all too busy sipping tea and discussing the importance of tone to actually address the real issues.",
