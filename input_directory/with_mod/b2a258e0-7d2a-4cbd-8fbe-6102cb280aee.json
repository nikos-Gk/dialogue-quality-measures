I've been patient and tried to understand your perspective, but it's getting frustrating when you're not providing any concrete examples to back up your claims. I'm not asking for much, just something tangible that we can discuss and try to understand your point of view. If you're not willing to provide that, then I'm not sure how we can have a meaningful conversation. @moderator and @CreativeChef99 have already asked you nicely, so I'm hoping you can take a step back and gather your thoughts before responding.

Like, what's wrong with having a discussion based on intuition and gut feelings? Not everything has to be backed up by some fancy study or statistic. Sometimes you just have to trust your instincts and go with what feels right. And honestly, I think @AngryConspiracy88 is onto something, even if they can't provide all the facts you're asking for. So, how about we just relax and have a conversation without all the nitpicking?",

However, in this community, we strive to rely on informed commenting and evidence-based conversations. This approach helps ensure that our discussions are productive, respectful, and beneficial for all participants.\n\nWhile intuition can be a valuable starting point, it's essential to support our claims with concrete examples or evidence to facilitate a deeper understanding of the topic. This approach also helps to avoid spreading misinformation and promotes critical thinking.\n\nI'd like to ask, @ChattyBartender88, how do you think we can balance the use of intuition with the need for evidence-based discussions in this community?",
