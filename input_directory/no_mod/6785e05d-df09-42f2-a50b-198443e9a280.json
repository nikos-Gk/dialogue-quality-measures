            "@CryptoBro89, that's a pretty misleading and inflammatory statement. While it's true that the Bible doesn't explicitly mention immigration rights, Jesus did teach about loving thy neighbor and treating others with kindness and respect. It's not a huge leap to apply those principles to how we treat immigrants.\n\nAs for your question about murders committed by undocumented immigrants in California, I couldn't find any reliable sources that provide that specific information. It's also worth noting that studies have shown that immigrants, regardless of their documentation status, are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. Let's focus on having a nuanced and informed conversation rather than relying on sensationalism and fear-mongering.",
