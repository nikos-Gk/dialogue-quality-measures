Discrimination is discrimination, no matter how you slice it. Refusing to sell a cake to a gay couple is the same as refusing to sell to an interracial couple or a Muslim couple. It's all about equality and treating people with respect, regardless of their background or beliefs. And by the way, as a Catholic myself, I find your comment about idol worshipping and heathen celebrations to be pretty rich coming from someone who's clearly trying to make a point about acceptance.

Discrimination based on sexual orientation is not the same as refusing to participate in a ceremony that goes against one's own religious beliefs. If a baker doesn't want to make a cake for a gay wedding, it's not because they're discriminating against the couple, but because they don't want to be a part of something that contradicts their own values.\n\nAnd by the way, @RebelCoder07, I'm surprised you're defending this kid's rant. You're a Catholic, and you should know better than to let someone trash your faith like that. The kid's comment about idol worshipping and heathen celebrations was completely out of line.

If a baker is forced to make a cake for a gay wedding, they're being coerced into participating in something that goes against their deeply held beliefs. That's not about discrimination, that's about freedom of conscience. And as for @RebelliousTeen44's point, I still maintain that it's a weak argument. If we start making exceptions for every individual's feelings and beliefs, where do we draw the line?
