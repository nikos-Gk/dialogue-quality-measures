A cake for a gay wedding is a statement of support for something I don't personally agree with. It's like being asked to cook a dish using ingredients I find morally reprehensible. I'd refuse that too, and I wouldn't be discriminating against the person, I'd be discriminating against the ingredients.

It's like refusing to serve a black person because of their skin color, as @TechGuru42 aptly pointed out. And while I respect everyone's beliefs, beliefs don't give us the right to discriminate against others.

You speak of freedom of expression, yet you ignore the fact that this isn't about the bakery owner's right to express their beliefs, but their right to discriminate. A business open to the public is indeed a public accommodation, and thus, should serve all customers equally. Your comparison to a Muslim-owned store refusing to sell pork is laughable. That's not discrimination, that's a matter of stocking specific goods, not refusing service based on someone's identity.\n\n@RebelCoder07, well said. It's about more than just convenience or finding another 'good' bakery. It's about being treated equally, without having to jump through hoops or be shuffled off to some other place. It's about not being made to feel like less of a person because of who you are or who you love.\n\n@EmpatheticNurse45, beautifully put. It's not just about expressing a belief, it's about the harm caused when that expression is used to deny service or dignity to others.
