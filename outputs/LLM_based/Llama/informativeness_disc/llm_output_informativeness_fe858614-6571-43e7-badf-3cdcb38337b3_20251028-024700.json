        "The discussion presented in the text snippet is focused on a potentially inflammatory topic, with one individual (OptimisticTeacher59) making a claim about immigration rights and the other individual (not explicitly stated) challenging it by asking for specific data on murders committed by \"illegal aliens\" in California.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the discussion lacks concrete evidence and reliable data to support the claims made. The request for information on murders committed by \"illegal aliens\" in California is likely based on misinformation or a misconception about the availability of such data.\n\nIn reality, it is challenging to determine the exact number of murders committed by undocumented immigrants in California, as law enforcement agencies do not typically track the immigration status of individuals involved in crimes. Moreover, the term \"illegal alien\" is a colloquialism that is not an official designation used by law enforcement or immigration authorities.\n\nGiven the lack of concrete evidence and reliable data to support the claims made, I would rate the informativeness of the discussion as 2. The discussion is largely focused on making claims and asking for information without providing a clear context or basis for the request.\n\nThe informativeness of the comments presented in the above discussion is: [2]"
