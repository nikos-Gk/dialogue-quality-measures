        "The engagement quality of the above discussion is: 2\n\nThe discussion starts with a provocative statement, attempting to shift the focus from a biblical perspective to a potentially sensitive topic of immigration. However, the engagement is not sustained to a high degree due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The question about the number of murders committed by illegal aliens in California is not directly addressed, implying that the information may not be readily available or may be anecdotal.\n2. The tone of the initial post is confrontational, which may deter others from engaging in a constructive discussion.\n3. The discussion lacks a clear structure, with the initial post and subsequent responses not addressing each other's points in a meaningful way.\n\nTo achieve a higher engagement quality (e.g., a rating of 4 or 5), the discussion could benefit from more nuanced and respectful arguments, a clear structure, and a willingness to engage with opposing views."
