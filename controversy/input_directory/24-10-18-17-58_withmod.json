If he's willing to make cakes for straight couples, then he should be willing to make them for gay couples as well. The idea that he can't ask people about their sexuality but somehow knows when someone is gay is ridiculous. It's like saying you can't ask someone if they're black or white but somehow know when they are. "

When an artist creates something for someone, they put their heart and soul into it. It's not just about the money; it's about the connection between the creator and the consumer. By refusing to create a cake for a same-sex couple, the baker is making a statement that goes beyond just a simple business deal. It's a statement of disapproval and rejection."

It's not about the baker being proud of his cakes; it's about him having the right to choose who he wants to serve and who he doesn't. If we start forcing people to create things that go against their beliefs, then where does it stop? Next thing you know, we'll be forced to bake cakes for Satanists or whatever other group we don't agree with. It's about freedom of speech and the right to choose what kind of art we want to create. If someone wants a cake that supports their lifestyle, they should find another baker who is willing to make it for them. Don't force people to do something that goes against their beliefs.

It's not about controlling people, it's about\nensuring fairness and equality for all. @DarkShadow333, I also\ndisagree with your interpretation of the Bible. The Bible is a book\nof love and compassion, not hate and intolerance. We should be\nusing our faith to bring people together, not tear them apart.\n@QueenOfChaos, I understand that you're upset about the government's\ninterference in people's lives, but we have to remember that this is\nabout ensuring everyone has equal access to services and opportunities.\nIt's not about controlling people; it's about promoting fairness and equality for all. @DarkShadow333, I also disagree with your interpretation of the Bible.

            "**Comment:**  @QueenOfChaos, you're so blinded by your own biases,\nyou can't even see the truth. The government is trying to control\npeople's lives, and this is just another example of that. They're\nusing the excuse of \"equality\" to push their agenda on everyone.\nAnd don't even get me started on the Bible. It's clear as day what\nit says about homosexuality. You can twist it all you want, but at\nthe end of the day, it's still a sin. @TechGuru88, I'm not sure\nwhat kind of Christianity you're practicing, but it sounds like you're\nmore interested in being popular than following God's word.\n"

            "**Comment:**  @QueenOfChaos, I gotta say, your argument is weak and full of holes. You keep saying that the baker should be able to discriminate based on their beliefs, but what about all the other protected classes? If it's okay for a baker to refuse service to someone because of their sexual orientation, then why can't they do the same thing to someone because of their race or gender? It's not like the baker is going to ask everyone who comes in if they're gay or straight. They're just going to make assumptions based on how people look or act. And what about all the other businesses that are already refusing service to certain groups? Are we just going to let them get away with it? I think you need to re-examine your beliefs and consider the harm that discrimination can cause.\n"
